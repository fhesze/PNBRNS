%% Creating a two-dimensional pore network
% This Matlab file is the main file for a series of files:
% (i) CreateGeometry.m, where the skeleton of the network is build
% (ii) RandomField.m, where random values are assigned to each pore
% (iii) CalculateFlow.m, where the fluid flow is solved for the network
% (iv) ComputeTransport.m, where the transport of several species is
% computed.
