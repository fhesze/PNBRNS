  abstract = {Abstract We present a process based method for reconstructing the
	full three-dimensional microstructure of sandstones. The method utilizes
	petrographical information obtained from two-dimensional thin sections
	to stochastically model the results of the main sandstone forming
	processes ï?`½ sedimentation, compaction, and diagenesis. We apply
	the method to generate Fontainebleau sandstone and compare quantitatively
	the reconstructed microstructure with microtomographic images of
	the actual sandstone. The comparison shows that the process based
	reconstruction reproduces adequately important intrinsic properties
	of the actual sandstone, such as the degree of connectivity, the
	specific internal surface, and the two-point correlation function.
	A statistical reconstruction of Fontainebleau sandstone that matches
	the porosity and two-point correlation function of the microtomography
	data differs strongly from the actual sandstone in its connectivity
	properties. Transport properties of the samples are determined by
	solving numerically the local equations governing the transport.
	Computed permeabilities and formation factors of process based reconstructions
	of Fontainebleau sandstone compare well with experimental measurements
	over a wide range of porosity.},

  school = {University of Jyv{\"a}skyl{\"a}, Department of Physics},
  year = {2005},
  abstract = {The lattice-Boltzmann method has recently become a useful approach
	for computational fluid dynamics. Simple implementation of boundary
	conditions together with inherent grid generation makes the method
	geometrically very versatile, and it is thus convenient for simulating
	complex systems such as fluid flow in porous media. Solving realistic
	flow problems has become feasible because of increased computing
	capabilities and parallel processing, for which the spatially local
	updating rules of the lattice-Boltzmann method are particularly suitable.
	In this thesis, fluid dynamics in porous media and the basic principles
	of the lattice-Boltzmann method are first introduced. Application
	of the method to flow simulations is then discussed in terms of some
	practical problems, such as boundary conditions, discretization errors
	and numerical stability, and benchmark studies are carried out to
	validate the method. Finally, several single-fluid flow problems
	in irregular 3D geometries are analyzed numerically. The lattice-Boltzmann
	simulations are used to find out the quality of tomographic imaging
	techniques and numerical models of porous media. Dependence of permeability
	on porosity and other structural properties such as specific surface
	area, tortuosity, and shape and orientation of particles in the medium,
	are demonstrated and compared to those given by other methods, theory
	and experiment. The effects of size and resolution of tomographic
	images of several paper grades are examined by simulating fluid flow
	through the images and by image analysis. The lattice-Boltzmann,
	image analysis and experimental results for the permeability of tomographic
	images of hand sheets with different refining levels are reported.
	Models and a tomographic image of sandstone are analyzed by comparing
	the lattice-Boltzmann and finite-difference results also with experiment.
	The effect of specific surface area, via fines content and shape
	of fibres, is demonstrated by the lattice-Boltzman flow simulations
	through fibre-web-model samples.},

  abstract = {{Stable isotope data have been increasingly used to assess in situ
	biodegradation of organic contaminants in groundwater. The data are
	usually evaluated using the Rayleigh equation to evaluate whether
	isotope data follow a Rayleigh trend, to calculate the extent of
	contaminant biodegradation, or to estimate first-order rate constants.
	However, the Rayleigh equation was developed for homogeneous systems
	while in the subsurface, contaminants can migrate at different velocities
	due to physical heterogeneity. This paper presents a method to quantify
	the systematic effect that is introduced by applying the Rayleigh
	equation to field isotope data. For this purpose the travel time
	distribution between source and sampling point is characterized by
	an analytical solution to the advection-dispersion equation. The
	systematic effect was evaluated as a function of the magnitude of
	physical heterogeneity, geometry of the contaminant plume, and degree
	of biodegradation. Results revealed that the systematic effect always
	leads to an underestimation of the actual values of isotope enrichment
	factors, the extent of biodegradation, or first-order rate constants,
	especially in the dispersion-dominant region representing a higher
	degree of physical heterogeneity. A substantial systematic effect
	occurs especially for the quantification of first-order rate constants
	(up to 50\% underestimation of actual rate) while it is relatively
	small for quantification of the extent of biodegradation (< 5\% underestimation
	of actual degree of biodegradation). The magnitude of the systematic
	effect is in the same range as the uncertainty due to uncertainty
	of the analytical data, of the isotope enrichment factor, and the
	average travel time.}},

	upscaling technique, the Brownian particle tracking model (BPTM).
	We model a porous medium with a network of pore-units that are comprised
	of pore bodies and bonds of finite volume. Such a pore-unit is assumed
	to be a mixing cell with the steady state flow condition for a single
	fluid. Dispersivity can be obtained by solving the mixing cell model

	concentrations for a large number of pore units (as a function of

	value of dispersivity was determined and verified with large size
	pore networks. This numerically computed dispersivity is compared
	with the results from the BPTM for the same porous medium and flow
	conditions. We show that the dispersivity obtained from the MCM is
	equally reliable for the heterogeneous pore-networks and can be estimated

	Additionally, we introduce a new method for derivation of DL based

	tracking method, we simulate Taylorï?`½s classical experiments in
	a single tube. Subsequently, we carry out network simulations for
	a wide range of the characteristic Pï?`½clet number Pe? to assess

	demonstrated that the length scale of transverse mixing zones can
	be very small, often on the order of millimeters or centimeters.
	In order to study dispersion, mixing and reaction at this scale,

	the following: (a) geometric construction of a packed bed of randomly
	sized, shaped and randomly oriented grains; (b) solution for the
	steady flow field by the Lattice-Boltzmann method; and (c) solution
	for the steady-state distribution of reactive chemicals using a finite

	simulation, we restrict our modeling to two space dimensions. We
	illustrate our approach through a steady- state system of two reactants
	injected side-by-side parallel to the mean flow direction; a kinetic
	bi-molecular reaction rate law is assumed. We first estimate the
	transverse dispersion coeiffcient through comparison of a continuum-scale
	model to the pore-scale simulation of the spread of a nonreactive
	solute. We then simulate the reactive case for different flow rates

	use of the transverse dispersion coeiffcient gives the proper degree
	of mixing to accurately simulate the amount of product formed in
	the system. The results are compared with available experimental
	evidence and theoretical findings. Our results indicate that transverse
	dispersion coefficients that describe spreading of nonreactive solutes
	also may be used to model transverse mixing and reaction.},

	phenomena with the pore structure and can also be incorporated into
	a pore-network model to verify existing models, understand, or predict
	transport and flow processes and phenomena in complex porous media
	systems. The algorithms are based on the three-dimensional skeletonization
	of the pore space in the form of nodes connected to paths. Dilation
	algorithms were developed to generate inscribed spheres on the nodes
	and paths of the medial axis to represent pore-bodies and pore-throats
	of the network, respectively. Pore-network structure is captured
	by threedimensional spatial distribution of pore-bodies and pore-throats,
	pore-body and porethroat size distributions, and the connectivity.
	Theoretical packings were used to verify the algorithms. Systems
	of glass bead and natural sand were used in this study to investigate
	the applicability of the algorithms. Additionally, porosity, specific
	surface area, and representative elementary volume (REV) analysis
	of porosity were calculated. The impact of resolution was investigated
	using perfect glass bead and natural sand systems. Finally, semivariograms
	and integral scale concepts were used as a tool to investigate the
	spatial correlation of the network. Results showed that microtomography
	is an effective tool to provide quantitative analysis of three-dimensional
	systems. The quality of the datasets depends on photon energy, photon
	flux, size and type of the sample, and the number of projections.
	The resolution has a significant impact on the construction of the
	medial axis and extraction of pore network parameters. This impact
	varies in its significance based on the system and the properties
	being calculated. Results highlighted the difficulty of creating
	a unique network from a complex, continuum pore space. Results showed
	that the algorithms developed are general in use and can be applied
	to any three-dimensional unconsolidated porous media system. Spatial
	correlation results showed that systems have different correlation
	behavior; therefore, it might be not correct if a correlation model
	is assigned a priori into a pore-network model.},

	the inverse problem in a maximum likelihood framework. The performance
	of the method is tested on a synthetic example. Results show that
	including the plausibility term improves the identification of heterogeneity.
	Furthermore, this term makes the inverse problem more stable and
	allows the use of larger number of pilot points, thus improving the

	using water-saturated micromodels. The micromodels were produced
	with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), using a soft photolithography technique
	that allows creating transparent patterns that have dimensions in

  abstract = {The dispersion of a chemically active solute in unidirectional laminar
	flow in a channel of constant cross-sectional area is considered.
	Adsorption/desorption of the solute at the wall or the presence of
	a bulk or surface chemical reaction introduce additional timescales,
	in addition to the diffusive and convective ones, such that, under
	certain conditions, the asymptotic evolution of the cross-sectional
	mean concentration cannot be described by a one-dimensional Taylor-Aris
	model. We use the centre and invariant manifold theories to establish
	the proper time and length scale separations necessary for the existence
	of an effective transport equation and to determine the dependence
	of the effective transport coefficients on the kinetics of adsorption/desorption
	and reaction. For the case of classical Taylor-Aris dispersion with
	no reaction, we derive the effective transport equation to infinite
	order in the parameter, p, representing the ratio of the characteristic
	time for radial molecular diffusion to that for axial convection.
	We show that the infinite series in the effective transport model
	is convergent provided p is smaller than some critical value, which
	depends on the initial concentration distribution. We also examine
	the spatial evolution of time dependent inlet conditions and show
	that the spatial and temporal evolutions differ at third and higher
	orders. It is shown that, except for slow reactions with a kinetic
	timescale of the same order as the transverse diffusion time, fast
	bulk reaction does not allow an asymptotic axial dispersion description.
	Slow bulk reactions do not affect dispersion but a correction to
	the apparent kinetics may arise due to nonlinear interaction among
	reaction, diffusion and convection. It is also shown that with a
	slow bulk reaction, steady-state dispersion due to a coupling of
	reaction and transverse velocity gradient can arise. Although this
	mechanism is distinct from the transient Taylor-Aris mechanism, the
	dispersion coefficient is identical to the classical unreactive Taylor-Aris
	coefficient. Surface reaction of any speed yields the proper asymptotic
	behaviour in time because the species still needs to diffuse slowly
	to the conduit wall. In the limit of fast surface reaction, the Taylor-Aris
	dispersion coefficient is reduced by a factor of 4.2, 7.1 and 4.0
	for pipe, plane Poiseuille and Couette flows, respectively, as the
	slow-moving solutes near the wall are depleted. For the case of a
	linear surface reaction, we use the invariant manifold theory to
	derive the effective transport equation to infinite order. We also
	show that the radius of convergence of the invariant manifold expansion
	is approximately three times that of the no reaction case. We demonstrate
	that if adsorption/desorption is as slow as transverse diffusion,
	an adsorption-induced dispersion, distinct from the Taylor-Aris shear
	dispersion, exists. While the total dispersion may increase because
	of the contribution of both, the Taylor-Aris component is reduced
	by a physical mechanism similar to surface reaction. The adsorption/desorption
	induced dispersion coefficient is shown to have a maximum when the
	adsorption equilibrium constant is exactly 2. Nonlinear Langmuir
	type adsorption at large concentration is shown to introduce a nonlinear
	drift term which causes non-Gaussian pulse responses with long tails.
	These tails are detrimental to separation chromatography since they
	cause overlaps which increase with the length of the chromatograph.},

  abstract = {In dieser Vorlesung geht es darum, wie man mehrere Computer benutzen
	kann um die Berechnung eines Problemes zu beschleunigen. Warum sollte
	man dies tun? Es gibt daf{\"u}r mindestens drei Gr{\"u}nde. Zun{\"a}chst
	die absolute Rechenleistung. Viele Problemstellungen haben unstillbaren
	Hunger nach Rechenleistung. Sequentielle Rechner erreichen irgendwann
	prinzipielle physikalische Grenzen (Atomgr{\"o}{\{ss}}e, Lichtgeschwindigkeit),
	dar{\"u}berhinaus ist keine Leistungssteigerung mehr m{\"o}glich.
	Heutige Rechner haben vor allem das Problem, dass die Daten nicht
	schnell genug aus dem Speicher gelesen werden k{\"o}nnen um mit dem
	Prozessor Schritt zu halten, auch hier sind Parallelrechner eine
	L{\"o}sung. Die leistungsf{\"a}higsten heute verf{\"u}gbaren Rechner
	sind Parallelrechner. Waren Parallelrechner fr{\"u}her eine Sache
	f{\"u}r Gro{\{ss}}forschungseinrichtungen und Universit{\"a}ten,
	so hat sich dies mit der Verf{\"u}gbarkeit von billiger und schneller
	Ethernet Hardware und dem Betriebssystem LINUX drastisch ge{\"a}ndert.

	PCs mit zwei Prozessoren sind Standard. PC-basierte Parallelrechner
	bieten ein besseres Preis/Leisungsverh{\"a}ltnis als Workstations,
	vorausgesetzt man hat entsprechend parallelisierte Software. Als
	letzter Grund soll genannt werden, dass sich viele Anwendungsprobleme
	in nat{\"u}rlicher Weise parallel formulieren lassen. Man denke etwa
	an einen Web Browser wie Netscape. Das Herunterladen einer (oder
	mehrerer) Dateien und die Darstellung von Webseiten ist (quasi) gleichzeitig

  abstract = {Various abiotic and biotic processes such as sorption, dilution, and
	degradation are known to affect the fate of organic contaminants,

	transport modeling of such plumes indicates that the biodegradation
	of organic pollutants is, in many cases, controlled by mixing and
	therefore occurs locally at the plume's fringes, where electron donors
	and electron-acceptors mix. Herein, we aim to test whether this hypothesis
	can be verified by experimental results obtained from aerobic and
	anaerobic degradation experiments in two-dimensional sediment microcosms.
	Toluene was selected as a model compound for oxidizable contaminants.
	The two-dimensional microcosm was filled with quartz sand and operated
	under controlled flow conditions simulating a contaminant plume in
	otherwise uncontaminated groundwater. Aerobic degradation of toluene
	by Pseudomonas putida mt-2 reduced a continuous 8.7 mg L− 1 toluene
	concentration by 35\% over a transport distance of 78 cm in 15.5
	h. In comparison, under similar conditions Aromatoleum aromaticum
	strain EbN1 degraded 98\% of the toluene infiltrated using nitrate
	(68.5 ± 6.2 mg L− 1) as electron acceptor. A major part of the biodegradation
	activity was located at the plume fringes and the slope of the electron-acceptor
	gradient was steeper during periods of active biodegradation. The
	distribution of toluene and the significant overlap of nitrate at
	the plume's fringe indicate that biokinetic and/or microscale transport
	processes may constitute additional limiting factors. Experimental
	data is corroborated with results from a reactive transport model
	using double Monod kinetics. The outcome of the study shows that
	in order to simulate degradation in contaminant plumes, detailed
	data sets are required to test the applicability of models. These
	will have to deal with the incorporation of existing parameters coding

	an explicit representation of all dynamical scales. Instead, most
	models are constructed at such a coarse scale of resolution that
	unresolved subgrid variability often exists. It is therefore important
	to understand the interaction between unresolved dynamics and explicitly
	resolved dynamics. The concept of universality is central to this
	interaction and is here related to the problem of rescaling models
	of groundwater flow. We examine when it is possible to construct
	an accurate model for the explicitly resolved large scales, without
	an explicit description of the subgrid scale dynamics. We demonstrate
	how unresolved subgrid scale dynamics interact with resolved scale
	dynamics. We show that a universally valid resolved scale model can
	be constructed if the resolved dynamics are sufficiently independent
	of the details of the subgrid scale dynamics. In that event, a resolved
	scale model is composed of a universal structure and accompanying
	model parameters. The model parameters represent the effect of unresolved
	dynamics upon resolved dynamics. We examine two possible model structures
	for groundwater flow. We show theoretically, and numerically, that
	a local Darcy law is a universally valid resolved scale model if
	the resolved and subgrid scales of the hydraulic conductivity are
	separated in scale by a so-called spectral gap. If, however, the
	hydraulic conductivity possesses many scales of variability, then
	a more general nonlocal Darcy law is a more appropriate model structure.
	When the nonlocal Darcyï?`½s law is more appropriate, numerical experiments
	suggest that errors using a local Darcyï?`½s law with effective parameters
	are most significant at the smallest resolving scale of the model,
	and are minimal at scales between 8 and 16 times the resolving scale.},

  abstract = {A large-scale fluid flow and solute transport model was developed
	for the crystalline bedrock at Olkiluoto Island, Finland, which is
	considered as potential deep geological repository for spent nuclear
	fuel. Site characterization showed that the main flow pathways in
	the low-permeability crystalline bedrock on the island are 13 subhorizontal
	fracture zones. Compared to other sites investigated in the context
	of deep disposal of spent nuclear fuel, most deep boreholes drilled
	at Olkiluoto are not packed-off but are instead left open. These
	open boreholes intersect the main fracture zones and create hydraulic
	connections between them, thus modifying groundwater flow. The combined
	impact of fracture zones and open boreholes on groundwater flow is
	simulated at the scale of the island. The modeling approach couples
	a geomodel that represents the fracture zones and boreholes with
	a numerical model that simulates fluid flow and solute transport.
	The geometry of the fracture zones that are intersected by boreholes
	is complex, and the 3D geomodel was therefore constructed with a
	tetrahedral mesh. The geomodel was imported into the numerical model
	to simulate a pumping test conducted on Olkiluoto Island. The pumping
	test simulation demonstrates that fracture–borehole intersections
	must be accurately discretized, because they strongly control groundwater
	flow. The tetrahedral mesh provides an accurate representation of
	these intersections. The calibrated flow model was then used for
	illustrative scenarios of radionuclide migration to show the impact
	of fracture zones on solute transport once the boreholes were backfilled.
	These mass transport simulations constitute base cases for future
	predictive analyses and sensitivity studies, since they represent
	key processes to take into consideration for repository performance
	assessment.},

	an intermediate mesh generation phase. As a first step, a platform
	for 3D geological modeling is used to represent fractures as 2D surfaces
	with arbitrary shape and orientation in 3D space. The advantage of
	the geological modeling platform is that 2D triangulated fracture
	surfaces are modeled and visualized before building a 3D mesh. The
	triangulated fractures are then transferred to the mesh generation
	software that discretizes the 3D simulation domain with tetrahedral
	elements. The 2D triangular fracture elements do not cut through
	the 3D tetrahedral elements, but they rather form interfaces with
	them. The tetrahedral mesh is then used for 3D groundwater flow and
	contaminant transport simulations in discretely fractured porous
	media. The resulting mesh for the 2D fractures and 3D rock matrix
	is checked to ensure that there are no negative transmissibilities
	in the discretized flow and transport equation, to avoid unrealistic
	results. To test the validity of the approach, flow and transport
	simulations for a tetrahedral mesh are compared to simulations using

  abstract = {{A method for upscaling coupled hydro-mechanical properties in fractured
	rock from the small (metre) scale to the large (decametre to kilometre)
	scale has been developed and applied within a stochastic modelling
	framework. The method was implemented to assess the impact on estimates
	of advective travel times and transport pathways in the geosphere
	arising from uncertainties in the mechanical properties of a fractured
	host rock. A 2D hypothetical geological environment for a deep nuclear
	waste repository, characterized using rock and fracture property
	data from the site investigations at Sellafield, UK, was used for
	the assessment. Hydro-mechanical modelling was undertaken to obtain
	block scale equivalent hydraulic properties for discrete fracture
	networks described by power-law statistics for fracture length and
	density. Values of the mechanical properties for the host rock were
	employed to derive a basic statistical model of the uncertainty in
	the key fracture property values: joint compressive strength (JCS)
	and joint roughness coefficient (JRC). The block upscaling was carried
	out in two stages. First, mechanical modelling was undertaken to
	determine aperture distributions throughout each modelled fracture
	network using the distinct element code UDEC. The Barton-Bandis model
	for fracture closure was adopted in UDEC and each fracture network
	was modelled under a range of stress conditions with five (JCS, JRC)
	pairs that reflected the spread of mechanical properties observed
	in the actual field data. Second, mean block scale hydraulic conductivity
	tensors were determined for each stress and mechanical property combination
	by inverting the results from steady state hydraulic models for the
	mechanically controlled fracture networks. Finally, a Monte-Carlo
	simulation experiment was performed on a 2D profile model of the
	geosphere populated by sampling from the block upscaled hydraulic
	results. Particle tracking was applied to each realisation of the
	flow field in the geosphere to study the range of advective travel
	times from the repository to the seabed (biosphere). The simulated
	travel times were found to depend significantly on the rock and fracture
	mechanical properties with breakthrough times at the seabed ranging
	between 4000 years and 2,560,000 years. The spread of travel times
	in the simulation results demonstrate the significance of both hydro-mechanical
	rock properties and their spatial distribution. The very low joint
	compressive strength (JCS) of the uppermost formation and the assumed
	lateral uniformly distributed mechanical and hydraulic parameters
	of this formation are observed to provide the dominant control on
	the particle travel times. The present study suggests that observations
	of hydro-mechanical property data and their spatial distribution
	can offer useful additional information for developing models of
	the regional scale hydraulic behaviour of a fractured host rock mass.

  abstract = {Scaling in fracture systems has become an active field of research
	in the last 25 years motivated by practical applications in hazardous
	waste disposal, hydrocarbon reservoir management, and earthquake
	hazard assessment. Relevant publications are therefore spread widely
	through the literature. Although it is recognized that some fracture
	systems are best described by scale-limited laws (lognormal, exponential),
	it is now recognized that power laws and fractal geometry provide
	widely applicable descriptive tools for fracture system characterization.
	A key argument for power law and fractal scaling is the absence of
	characteristic length scales in the fracture growth process. All
	power law and fractal characteristics in nature must have upper and
	lower bounds. This topic has been largely neglected, but recent studies
	emphasize the importance of layering on all scales in limiting the
	scaling characteristics of natural fracture systems. The determination
	of power law exponents and fractal dimensions from observations,
	although outwardly simple, is problematic, and uncritical use of
	analysis techniques has resulted in inaccurate and even meaningless
	exponents. We review these techniques and suggest guidelines for
	the accurate and objective estimation of exponents and fractal dimensions.
	Syntheses of length, displacement, aperture power law exponents,
	and fractal dimensions are found, after critical appraisal of published
	studies, to show a wide variation, frequently spanning the theoretically
	possible range. Extrapolations from one dimension to two and from
	two dimensions to three are found to be nontrivial, and simple laws
	must be used with caution. Directions for future research include
	improved techniques for gathering data sets over great scale ranges
	and more rigorous application of existing analysis methods. More
	data are needed on joints and veins to illuminate the differences
	between different fracture modes. The physical causes of power law
	scaling and variation in exponents and fractal dimensions are still
	poorly understood.},

	Two schemes, the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) and the Eulerian-Lagrangian

	The other three schemes are the Random Walk Particle Tracking (RWPT),

  year = {2008},
  volume = {{44}},
  number = {{8}},
  month = {{Aug 23}},
  abstract = {{Discrete fracture network (DFN) and stochastic continuum (SC) are
	two common modeling approaches used for simulating fluid flow and
	solute transport in fractured media. Fracture continuum approaches
	combine the merits of each approach; details of the fracture network
	are preserved, and a computationally efficient grid is utilized for
	the solution of fluid flow by assigning a conductivity contrast between
	the grid cells representing the rock matrix and those representing
	fractures. In this paper, we propose a fracture continuum approach
	for mapping individual fractures onto a finite-difference grid as
	conductivity fields. We focus on several issues that are associated
	with this approach, such as enhanced connectivity between fractures
	that would otherwise not be in connection in a DFN simulation and
	the influence of grid cell size. To addresses these issues, both
	DFN and the proposed approach are used to solve for fluid flow through
	two-dimensional, randomly generated fracture networks in a steady-state,
	single-phase flow system. The DFN flow solution is used as a metric
	to evaluate the robustness of the method in translating discrete
	fractures onto grid cell conductivities on four different regularly
	spaced grids: 1 x 1 m, 2 x 2 m, 5 x 5 m, and 10 x 10 m. Two correction
	factors are introduced to ensure equivalence between the total flow
	of the grid and the original fracture network. The first is dependent
	on the fracture alignment with the grid and is set to account for
	the difference between the length of the flow path on the grid and
	that of the fracture. The other correction is applied for areas in
	the grid with high fracture density and accounts for the artificial
	degree of connectivity that exists on the grid but not in the DFN.
	Fifteen different cases are studied to evaluate the effect of fracture
	statistics on the results of the proposed approach and by taking
	average results of 100 realizations in each case in a stochastic
	Monte Carlo framework. The flow equation is solved for the DFN, and
	total flow is obtained. The flow is also solved separately for the
	four-grid resolution levels, and comparisons between the DFN and
	the grid total flows are made for the different cases and the different
	grid resolution levels. The approach performed relatively well in
	all cases for the fine-grid resolution, but an overestimation of
	grid flow is observed in the coarse-grid resolution, especially for
	cases wherein the network connectivity is controlled by small fractures.
	This overestimation shows minor variation from one realization to
	another within the same case. This allowed us to develop an approach
	that depends on solving limited number of DFN simulations to obtain
	this overestimation factor. Results indicate that the proposed approach
	provides improvements over existing approaches and has a potential
	to provide a link between DFN and SC models.}},

	of VOC vapor concentrations and compound-specific isotope ratios
	(delta C-13) were performed at the source and along the column. Initially,
	the compounds became depleted in C-13 by up to -4.8 parts per thousand
	along the column axis, until at 26 h, uniform isotope profiles were
	observed for most compounds, which is expected for steady-state diffusion.
	Subsequently, several compounds (n-pentane, benzene, n-hexane) became

	significant decrease in the source vapor concentration and a gradual
	enrichment of C-13 by up to 5.3 parts per thousand at the source

	by a larger diffusive mass flux for molecules with light isotopes

	followed closely a Rayleigh trend and the obtained isotope enrichment
	factor corresponded well to the ratio between the diffusion coefficients

	- The recent years have seen a growing awareness of the role played
	by fractures in petroleum reservoirs production and recovery. Hence,
	much effort was devoted to the diagnosis of fracture presence and
	impact on production. However, turning that diagnosis into field
	development decisions goes through reservoir simulation. This paper
	addresses some of the specificities of fractured reservoirs that
	make that their simulation is both challenging and rewarding: Indeed,
	the integration of fractures into allow simulation model is not straightforward
	because of the existing gap between the geological fault/fracture
	network and the fingerprint of that network on often-complex recovery
	mechanisms. Considering that fractures may impede or enhance production,
	fractured reservoir simulation may be seen as a technical challenge
	with potentially-high reward. This paper underlines that specific
	framework as an introduction to two technical articles dedicated
	to dual-porosity reservoir simulation. Although it constitutes another
	major aspect of any fractured reservoir study, the geological characterization
	of fractures is not discussed herein, but only evoked because of

	reservoirs have benefited from major advances in recent years. However,
	the reservoir engineer is still faced with the difficulty of parameterizing
	the dual-porosity model used to represent such reservoirs. In particular,
	the equivalent fracture permeabilities and the equivalent matrix
	block dimensions of such a model cannot be easily derived from observation
	of the complex images of natural fracture networks. This paper describes
	a novel and systematic methodology to compute these equivalent parameters.
	The results of its implementation with specially-designed software
	demonstrate its validity and efficiency in dealing with field situations.
	A tensor of equivalent fracture permeability is derived from single-phase
	steady-state flow computations on the actual fracture network using
	a 3D resistor network method and specific boundary conditions. The
	equivalent block dimensions in each layer are derived from the rapid
	identification of a geometrical function based on capillary imbibition.
	The methodology was validated against fine-grid reference simulations
	with a conventional reservoir simulator. Then, a complex outcrop
	image of a sandstone formation was processed for demonstration purposes.

	its relation with dispersion. We explored the effect of pore size

	By solving the flow equations, we obtained a complete description

	directions were roughly perpendicular to each other. We estimated
	their multifractal dimension spectra and showed that the correlation
	dimension was a reliable quantitative indicator of flow channelling.
	We then simulated solute dispersion in these networks using a previously

	in the preferential flow paths, as well as the effective cation exchange
	capacity and the base saturation. Microbial biomass determined with

	plots (v/S versus v, where v is the rate of substrate uptake), which

	A third derived parameter, the affinity constant KA, is similar to

	the specific affinity by half. It can be determined in the absence
	of a maximal velocity measurement and is equal to the Michaelis constant
	for a system with hyperbolic kinetics. Both are taken as a measure

	ratios. Compilation of kinetic data indicates a 108-fold range in

	Data suggest that both specific affinities and maximal velocities

	The whole-cell Michaelis constant (KT), which depends on the ratio

	universally rather constant so that oligotrophy is scaled on a plot
	of a°A versus KT, with better oligotrophs toward one end. This idea
	is borne out by experimental data, and therefore typical small difficult-to-culture

  abstract = {Quantitative hydrogeology often relies on numerical modeling of flow
	and transport processes in the earth subsurface. Despite the richness
	of numerical schemes proposed in the literature most applications
	are performed by using a few very popular codes based on classical
	finite volume or finite element techniques. An important limitation
	of these numerical schemes is that they lead to solutions that do
	not satisfy the refraction law of streamlines at element (or volume)
	edges. This is not of great concern when the hydraulic conductivity
	K is spatially homogeneous, or varies smoothly within the computational
	domain. However, the solution may deteriorate in heterogeneous formations
	with high contrast between the hydraulic conductivity of adjacent
	computational cells. We analyze the performance of four widely used
	classic numerical schemes for solving the flow equation when they
	are applied to heterogeneous porous media. We first analyze the convergence
	of the numerical schemes to a known analytical solution in a simple
	heterogeneous field composed by 4 blocks with contrasting hydraulic
	conductivities. Then we compare the numerical solutions obtained
	in both Gaussian and exponential weakly heterogeneous logconductivity
	fields with existing analytical first- and second-order solutions
	in the variance of the logconductivity field, σ Y 2 . Our analysis
	highlights that postprocessing the velocity field to enforce a posteriori
	the refraction law leads to biased results and that the performance
	of the numerical scheme depends on how mass conservation is discretized
	on the computational grid. Numerical schemes using inter-block conductivities,
	based for example on the harmonic mean, modify the spatial structure
	of the conductivity, with a negative impact on the structure of the
	velocity field.},

	trapping, although assessed indirectly, is also probably more relevant

  abstract = {A number of conceptual models have been proposed for simulating groundwater
	flow and solute transport in fractured systems. They span the range
	from continuum porous equivalents to discrete channel networks. The
	objective of this paper is to show the application of an intermediate
	approach (mixed discrete-continuum models) to three cases. The approach
	consists of identifying the dominant fractures (i.e., those carrying
	most of the flow) and modeling them explicitly as two-dimensional
	features embedded in a three-dimensional continuum representing the
	remaining fracture network. The method is based on the observation
	that most of the water flows through a few fractures, so that explicitly
	modeling them should help in properly accounting for a large portion
	of the total water flow. The applicability of the concept is tested
	in three cases. The first one refers to the Chalk River Block (Canada)
	in which a model calibrated against a long crosshole test successfully
	predicted the response to other tests performed in different fractures.
	The second case refers to hydraulic characterization of a large-scale
	(about 2 km) site at El Cabril (Spain). A model calibrated against
	long records (five years) of natural head fluctuations could be used
	to predict a one-month-long hydraulic test and heads variations after
	construction of a waste disposal site. The last case refers to hydraulic
	characterization performed at the Grimsel Test Site in the context
	of the Full-scale Engineered Barrier EXperiment (FEBEX). Extensive
	borehole and geologic mapping data were used to build a model that
	was calibrated against five crosshole tests. The resulting large-scale
	model predicted steady-state heads and inflows into the test tunnel.
	The conclusion is that, in all cases, the difficulties associated
	with the mixed discrete-continuum approach could be overcome and
	that the resulting models displayed some predictive capabilities.},

	radial flow model is an alternative method for hydraulic test interpretation
	that infers an additional parameter, the flow dimension n, to describe

	models of aquifer tests in two-dimensional fractured media, with
	the objective of understanding the relationships between the parameters
	of a discrete fracture network (DFN) with lengths distributed as
	a power law, the flow dimension, and the regime of hydraulic diffusion
	(e. g., Fickian or non-Fickian). The diffusion regime of each realization
	was evaluated using < R-2 > similar to t(k), where t is time, < R-2
	> is the mean squared radius of hydraulic diffusion, and an apparent
	value of k = 1 indicates normal (Fickian) diffusion and k < 1 indicates
	anomalous (non-Fickian) diffusion. For the DFN model, the apparent
	flow dimension and exponent k depend on both the density and the
	power of the fracture length distribution, and thus also on the connectivity
	regime of the fracture network system. Depending on the connectivity
	regime, the apparent flow dimension stabilizes to less than the Euclidean
	dimension and the apparent value of k < 1 indicates that hydraulic
	diffusion is non-Fickian. These results suggest that the flow dimension
	and the exponent k may be useful for characterizing flow and transport

	However, most existing reactive transport models, for example in
	the field of contaminant hydrology, are specialized either in the
	simulation of the reactive or of the flow and transport processes.
	In this paper, we present and test the coupling of two highly flexible
	codes for the simulation of reactive transport processes in the subsurface:
	the Biogeochemical Reaction Network Simulator (BRNS), which contains
	a solver for kinetically and thermodynamically constrained biogeochemical
	reactions, and GeoSys/RockFIow, a multidimensional finite element
	subsurface flow and transport simulator. The new model, named GeoSysBRNS,
	maintains the full flexibility of the original models. The coupling
	is handled using an operator splitting scheme, which allows the reactive
	solver to be compiled into a problem specific library that is accessed
	by the transport simulator at runtime. The accuracy of the code coupling
	within GeoSysBRNS is demonstrated using two benchmark problems from
	the literature: a laboratory experiment on organic carbon degradation
	in a sand column via multiple microbial degradation pathways, and
	a dispersive mixing controlled bioreactive transport problem in aquifers,

  abstract = {{One of the challenges of hydrology is modeling flow and solute transport
	through media that are not uniformly porous. This paper proposes
	a general fractal model of flow and solute transport in randomly
	heterogeneous porous media. We describe the random field using fractional
	Levy motion (fLm), which more effectively represents a field with
	a high degree of variability. Understanding flow and solute transport
	in the fLm field expands the applicability of stochastic theory.
	Following the work of V. Di Federico and S. P. Neuman (1997) and
	V. Di Federico et al. (1999), we derive truncated isotropic and anisotropic
	power variograms for the fLm fields. The results are analogous to
	but more general than those of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) (V.
	Di Federico and S. P. Neuman (1997) and V. Di Federico et al. (1999)).
	For a random field, when the Levy index a in fLm is replaced by a
	constant of 2, fBm is recovered. This study employs first-order perturbation
	analyses of flow and solute transport in two-dimensional fLm fields.
	For the stationary, fBm, and fLm fields, macrodispersion coefficients
	are compared. The plume is found to grow slowest in the fLm field
	but will show highest concentration. The proposed fractal model is
	general in the sense that when the Levy index of fLm alpha equals
	2, the results of flow and solute transport for the commonly used
	fBm model are recovered. When the upper cutoff of the truncated power
	variogram is close to the lower cutoff, the results for the stationary
	exponential or Gaussian model can be well approximated. Since the
	proposed general fractal model has broader applications than the
	stationary and fBm models, it simulates flow and solute transport
	in more different scenarios to yield more accurate modeling results.}},

	The results show that microbial reaction rates are always limited

	with compounds in the ambient water. In our application, we use an
	alkaline solution injected into acidic ambient water. Threshold values
	of pH are visualized by adding standard pH indicators. Since aqueous-phase
	acid-base reactions can be considered practically instantaneous and
	the only process leading to mixing of the reactants is transverse
	dispersion, the length of the plume is controlled by the ratio of
	transverse dispersion to advection. We use existing closed-form expressions
	for multidimensional steady-state transport of conservative compounds
	in order to evaluate the concentration distributions of the reacting
	compounds. Based on these results, we derive an easy-to-use expression
	for the length of the reactive plume; it is proportional to the injection
	height squared, times the velocity, and inversely proportional to
	the transverse dispersion coefficient. Solving this expression for
	the transverse dispersion coefficient, we can estimate its value
	from the length of the alkaline plume. We apply the method to two
	experimental setups of different dimension. The computed transverse
	dispersion coefficients are rather small. We conclude that at slow
	but realistic ground water velocities, the contribution of effective
	molecular diffusion to transverse dispersion cannot be neglected.
	This results in plume lengths that increase with increasing velocity.},

  abstract = {We compare two models that have been used frequently for describing
	biodegradation during contaminant transport in groundwater. One is
	a ï?`½simpleï?`½ model based upon macroscopic properties only, and
	the other is a ï?`½biofilmï?`½ model that accounts for contaminant
	diffusion and reaction in biofilms. Although the simple model has
	been used frequently, its mathematical formulation appears inadequate
	to describe the physics of the biodegradation process. Hence it is
	unclear when the simple model should be considered valid, and analyses
	predicated upon the simple model are called into question. We resolve
	this issue by arguing that the simple model should be considered
	valid when it is mathematically equivalent to the conceptually superior
	biofilm model. We demonstrate that the two models are exactly equivalent
	at the macroscopic scale when steady state conditions prevail. Under
	these conditions the equivalent macroscopic degradation rate coefficient
	k can be related to microscopic rate parameters that describe mass
	transfer across a boundary layer, diffusion within the biofilm, and
	reaction within the biofilm. Under transient (nonsteady state) conditions
	the two models are not strictly equivalent. However, the error between
	the two models is negligible in certain cases. In particular, when
	the rate-limiting step for biodegradation is either mass transfer
	across the boundary layer or diffusion within the biofilm, there
	is no distinguishable difference between the predictions of the two

  abstract = {Solute transport in porous formations is governed by the large-scale
	heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity. The two typical lengthscales
	are the local one (of the order of metres) and the regional one (of
	the order of kilometres). The formation is modelled as a random fixed
	structure, to reflect the uncertainty of the space distribution of
	conductivity, which has a lognormal probability distribution function.
	A first-order perturbation approximation, valid for small log-conductivity
	variance, is used in order to derive closed-form expressions of the
	Eulerian velocity covariances for uniform average flow. The Concentration
	expectation value is determined by using a similar approximation,
	and it satisfies a diffusion equation with time-dependent apparent
	dispersion coefficients. The longitudinal coefficients tend to constant
	values in both two- and three-dimensional flows only after the solute
	body has travelled a few tens of conductivity integral scales. This
	may be an exceedingly large distance in many applications for which
	the transient stage prevails. Comparison of theoretical results with
	recent field experimental data is quite satisfactory. The variance
	of the space-averaged concentration over a volume V may be quite
	large unless the lengthscale of the initial solute body or of V is
	large compared with the conductivity integral scale. This condition
	is bound to be obeyed for transport at the local scale, in which
	case the concentration may be assumed to satisfy the ergodic hypothesis.
	This is not generally the case at the regional scale, and the solute
	concentration is subjected to large uncertainty. The usefulness of
	the prediction of the concentration expectation value is then quite
	limited and the dispersion coefficients become meaningless. In the
	second part of the study, the influence of knowledge of the conductivity
	and head at a set of points upon transport is examined. The statistical
	moments of the velocity and concentration fields are computed for
	a subensemble of formations and for conditional probability distribution
	functions of conductivity and head, with measured values kept fixed
	a t the set of measurement points. For conditional statistics the
	velocity is not stationary, and its mean and variance vary throughout
	the space, even if its unconditional mean and variance are constant.
	The main aim of the analysis is to examine the reduction of concentration
	coefficient of variation, i.e. of its uncertainty, by conditioning.
	It is shown that measurements of transmissivity on a grid of points
	can be effective in reducing concentration variance, provided that
	the distance between the points is smaller than two conductivity
	integral scales. Head conditioning has a lesser effect upon variance
	reduction.},

	aim of the study is to determine the spatial moments of the plume,
	i.e., of fluid particle trajectories, for highly heterogeneous aquifers,
	for which ? Y > 1, where Y = ln K. A multi-indicator model of the
	permeability structure, which is different from the common multi-Gaussian
	one, is proposed: the formation is modeled as a collection of N blocks
	of different K (j). The structure is defined by the distribution
	of K (j), the blocks' shape, and the coordinates of their centroids.
	The following simplifications are adopted: the blocks are inclusions
	of a regular shape (circles, spheres for isotropic media investigated
	here) defined by the radius A, and the inclusions are not overlapping,
	and their centroids are distributed uniformly and independently in
	space. At the continuous limit the model is characterized by the
	joint pdf f(Y, A). The model is shown to be quite general and to
	comprise binary, bimodal, indicator variograms and unimodal distributions
	of Y as particular cases. The study is focused on the latter case,
	with Y normal N [?Y?, ? Y 2] and stationary covariance of given integral
	scale I Y ; these are the parameters commonly estimated for sedimentary
	formations. This leaves still freedom in selecting the pdf f(A).
	The simple model selected for semianalytical and numerical analysis
	is that of inclusions of radius R and volume fraction n, submerged
	in a matrix of effective conductivity K ef . The latter represents
	the effect of inclusions of much smaller radius, which appear as
	a nugget in the log conductivity two-point covariance. An approximate
	analytical solution of the flow is obtained by using a self-consistent
	approximation, while a fully numerical one is derived in part 3 [
	Jankovi? et al., 2003a ]. Transport is solved by particle tracking,
	and the time-dependent spatial moments (trajectories variance, skewness,
	kurtosis) are presented in part 2 [ Fiori et al., 2003 ]. In the
	self-consistent approximation the asymptotic longitudinal macrodispersivity
	? L , which is a function of Y, shows strong nonlinear effects: inclusions
	of large positive Y lead to a finite ? L , whereas ? L grows unbounded
	for those of negative Y. This effect is not captured by the common
	first-order approximation in ? Y , which is symmetrical and overestimates
	? L for Y > 0 and underestimates it for Y < 0. As a result, the second
	spatial moment is predicted accurately by the first-order approximation,
	by cancellation of errors, provided that f(Y) is symmetrical. However,
	the transient regime and higher-order moments are not captured by
	the first-order approximation.},

	aperture, and matrix tortuosity) common to all the reactive transport
	models. In the second and third steps, by fixing the common non-reactive
	flow and transport parameters, the sorption parameters (retardation
	factor, sorption coefficient, and kinetic rate constant) of each
	model are estimated using the breakthrough data of reactive tracers,
	neptunium and uranium, respectively. Based on the inverse modeling
	results, the seven sorption-process models are discriminated using
	four model discrimination (or selection) criteria, Akaike information
	criterion (AIC), modified Akaike information criterion (AlCc), Bayesian
	information criterion (BIC) and Kashyap information criterion (KIC).
	These criteria suggest the kinetic sorption process for modeling
	reactive transport of neptunium and uranium transport in both fracture
	and matrix. This conclusion is confirmed by two chemical criteria,
	the half reaction time and Damkohler number criterion. (C) 2011 Elsevier

  abstract = {{We develop a one-equation non-equilibrium model to describe the Darcy-scale
	transport of a solute undergoing biodegradation in porous media.
	Most of the mathematical models that describe the macroscale transport
	in such systems have been developed intuitively on the basis of simple
	conceptual schemes. There are two problems with such a heuristic
	analysis. First, it is unclear how much information these models
	are able to capture; that is, it is not clear what the model's domain
	of validity is. Second, there is no obvious connection between the
	macroscale effective parameters and the microscopic processes and
	parameters. As an alternative, a number of upscaling techniques have
	been developed to derive the appropriate macroscale equations that
	are used to describe mass transport and reactions in multiphase media.
	These approaches have been adapted to the problem of biodegradation
	in porous media with biofilms, but most of the work has focused on
	systems that are restricted to small concentration gradients at the
	microscale. This assumption, referred to as the local mass equilibrium
	approximation, generally has constraints that are overly restrictive.
	In this article, we devise a model that does not require the assumption
	of local mass equilibrium to be valid. In this approach, one instead
	requires only that, at sufficiently long times, anomalous behaviors
	of the third and higher spatial moments can be neglected; this, in
	turn, implies that the macroscopic model is well represented by a
	convection-dispersion-reaction type equation. This strategy is very
	much in the spirit of the developments for Taylor dispersion presented
	by Aris (1956). On the basis of our numerical results, we carefully
	describe the domain of validity of the model and show that the time-asymptotic
	constraint may be adhered to even for systems that are not at local
	mass equilibrium. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

  year = {2005},
  volume = {41},
  month = {Nov},
  abstract = {Modeling transport of reactive solutes is a challenging problem, necessary
	for understanding the fate of pollutants and geochemical processes
	occurring in aquifers, rivers, estuaries, and oceans. Geochemical
	processes involving multiple reactive species are generally analyzed
	using advanced numerical codes. The resulting complexity has inhibited
	the development of analytical solutions for multicomponent heterogeneous
	reactions such as precipitation/dissolution. We present a procedure
	to solve groundwater reactive transport in the case of homogeneous
	and classical heterogeneous equilibrium reactions induced by mixing
	different waters. The methodology consists of four steps: (1) defining
	conservative components to decouple the solution of chemical equilibrium
	equations from species mass balances, (2) solving the transport equations
	for the conservative components, (3) performing speciation calculations
	to obtain concentrations of aqueous species, and (4) substituting
	the latter into the transport equations to evaluate reaction rates.
	We then obtain the space-time distribution of concentrations and
	reaction rates. The key result is that when the equilibrium constant
	does not vary in space or time, the reaction rate is proportional
	to the rate of mixing, ?T u D ?u, where u is the vector of conservative
	components concentrations and D is the dispersion tensor. The methodology
	can be used to test numerical codes by setting benchmark problems
	but also to derive closed-form analytical solutions whenever steps
	2 and 3 are simple, as illustrated by the application to a binary
	system. This application clearly elucidates that in a three-dimensional
	problem both chemical and transport parameters are equally important
	in controlling the process.},

	homogenizing only the porous medium chemistry is not appropriate.
	We consider here reactive transport in a porous medium that is characterized
	by mass transfer between a mobile and a distribution of immobile

	of kinetic reaction rate constants and residence times in the immobile
	zones. We derive an effective reactive transport equation for the
	mobile solute that is characterized by non-local physical mass transfer
	and reaction terms. Specifically, chemical heterogeneity is upscaled
	in terms of a reactive memory function that integrates both chemical
	and physical heterogeneity. Mass transfer limitations due to physical
	heterogeneity yield effective kinetic rate coefficients that can
	be much smaller than the volumetric average of the local scale coefficients.
	These results help to explain and quantify the often reported discrepancy
	between observed field reaction rate constants and the ones obtained
	under well mixed laboratory conditions. Furthermore, these results
	indicate that transport under physical and chemical heterogeneity
	cannot be upscaled separately.},

	Results showed that the bioavailability rates (non-dimensional numbers

	model of a porous medium and a biofilm is attached to the channel

	volumetric rate. A numerical study is performed to obtain the dependence
	of the macrotransport coefficients on the Peclet number and Damkohler
	number. It is found that in some cases of practical importance the
	pore fluid is not well mixed, and mass transport limitations can
	control macroreaction rates. For diffusion-limited cases (large Damkohler
	numbers) increased solvent velocity can enhance the macroreaction
	rate by a factor of almost 3. Mean solute and mean solvent velocities
	are, in general, not equal, and mean solute velocities can exceed
	mean solvent velocities by 60\% at high Damkohler numbers. These
	results agree qualitatively with those of a previous numerical study

	is more effective at consuming the solute than biomass in the pore
	chamber. A comparison is made between mass transfer correlations

	wavelets. The Meyer wavelet is used here because its rapid decay
	properties allow for a very compact representation of the field.
	The Fourier-wavelet method is shown to be straightforward to implement,
	given the nature of the necessary precomputations and the run-time
	calculations, and yields comparable results with scaling behavior
	over as many decades as the physical space multiwavelet methods developed
	recently by two of the authors. However, the Fourier-wavelet method

	spectra generated through solutions of differential equations. Simulation
	results using this new technique and the well-known nonhierarchical
	simulation technique, the randomization method, are given and compared
	for both a simple shear layer model problem as well as a two-dimensional

	are more accurate for statistical quantities depending on moments
	higher than order 2, in addition to showing a quite smooth decay
	to zero on the scales smaller than the scaling regime when compared
	with the randomization method results. The only situation in which

	efficient occurs when no more than four decades of sea ling behavior
	are needed and the statistical quantities of interest depend only

  abstract = {{In a previous paper we offered an interpretation for the observation
	that the log hydraulic conductivity of geologic media often appears
	to be statistically homogeneous but with variance and integral scale
	which grow with the size of the region (window) being sampled. We
	did so by demonstrating that such behavior is typical of any random
	field with a truncated power (semi)variogram and that this field
	can be viewed as a truncated hierarchy of mutually uncorrelated homogeneous
	fields with either exponential or Gaussian spatial autocovariance
	structures. The low- and high-frequency cutoff scales lambda(l) and
	lambda(u) are related to the length scales of the sampling window
	and data support, respectively. We showed how this allo-cvs the use
	of truncated power variograms to bridge information about a multiscale
	random field across windows of different sizes, either at a given
	locale or between different locales. In this paper we investigate
	mean uniform steady state groundwater flow in unbounded domains where
	the log hydraulic conductivity forms : a truncated multiscale hierarchy
	of Gaussian fields, each associated with an exponential autocovariance.
	We start by deriving an expression for effective hydraulic conductivity,
	as a function of the Hurst coefficient H and the cutoff scales in
	one-, two-, and three-dimensional domains which is qualitatively
	consistent with experimental data. We then develop leading-order
	analytical expressions for two-and three-dimensional autocovariance
	and cross-covariance functions of hydraulic head, velocity, and log
	hydraulic conductivity versus H, lambda(l) and lambda(u); examine
	their behavior; and compare them with those corresponding to an exponential
	log hydraulic conductivity autocovariance. Our results suggest that
	it should be possible to bridge information about hydraulic heads
	and groundwater velocities across windows of disparate scales. In
	particular, when lambda(l) much greater than lambda(u), the variance
	of head is infinite in two dimensions and grows in proportion to
	lambda(l)(2+2H) in three dimensions, while the variance and longitudinal
	integral scale of velocity grow in proportion to lambda(l)(2H) and

	for the displacement covariance, and dispersion coefficient, of an
	ensemble of solute particles advected through such a flow held in
	two or three dimensions. Both quantities are functions of the mean
	travel distance s, the Hurst coefficient H, and the low-and high-frequency
	cutoff integral scales lambda(l) and lambda(u). The latter two are
	related to the length scales of the sampling window (region under

	one considers transport to be affected by a finite domain much larger
	than the mean travel distance, so that s much less than lambda(l)
	< infinity, then an early preasymptotic regime develops during which
	longitudinal and transverse dispersivities grow linearly with a.
	If one considers transport to be affected by a domain which increases
	in proportion to s, then lambda(l) and s are of similar order and
	a preasymptotic regime never develops. Instead, transport occurs
	under a regime that is perpetually close to asymptotic under the

  abstract = {{An interpretation is offered for the observation that the log hydraulic
	conductivity of geologic media often appears to be statistically
	homogeneous but with variance and integral scale which grow with
	domain size. We first demonstrate that the power (semi)variogram
	and associated spectra of random fields, having homogeneous isotropic
	increments, can be constructed as weighted integrals from zero to
	infinity (an infinite hierarchy) of exponential or Gaussian variograms
	and spectra of mutually uncorrelated homogeneous isotropic fields
	(modes). We then analyze the effect of filtering out (truncating)
	high- and low-frequency modes from this infinite hierarchy in the
	real and spectral domains. A low-frequency cutoff renders the truncated
	hierarchy homogeneous with an autocovariance function that varies
	monotonically with separation distance in a manner not too dissimilar
	than that of its constituent modes. The integral scales of the lowest-
	and highest-frequency modes (cutoffs) are related, respectively,
	to the length Scales of the sampling window (domain) and data support
	(sample volume). Taking each rerationship to be one of proportionality
	renders our expressions for the integral scale and variance of a
	truncated field dependent on window and support scares in a manner
	consistent with observations. The traditional approach of truncating
	power spectral densities yields autocovariance functions that oscillate
	about zero with finite (in one and two dimensions) or vanishing (in
	one dimension) integral scales. Our hierarchical theory allows bridging
	across scales at a specific locale, by calibrating a truncated variogram
	model to data observed on a given support in one domain and predicting
	the autocovariance structure of the corresponding multiscale field
	in domains that are either smaller or larger. One may also venture
	(we suspect with less predictive power) to bridge across both domain
	scales and locales by adopting generalized variogram parameters derived
	on the basis of juxtaposed hydraulic and tracer data from many sites.}},

  abstract = {{It has been shown by Di Federico and Neuman {[}1997, 1998a, b] that
	observed multiscale behaviors of subsurface fluid flow and transport
	variables can be explained within the context of a unified stochastic
	framework, which views hydraulic conductivity as a random fractal
	characterized by a power variogram. Such a random field is statistically
	nonhomogeneous but possesses homogeneous spatial increments. Di Federico
	and Neuman {[}1997] have demonstrated that the power variogram and
	associated spectra of a statistically isotropic fractal field can
	be constructed as a weighted integral from zero to infinity (an infinite
	hierarchy) of exponential or Gaussian variograms and spectra of mutually
	uncorrelated fields (modes) that are homogeneous and isotropic. We
	show in this paper that the same holds true when the field and its
	constituent modes are statistically anisotropic, provided the ratios
	between principal integral (spatial correlation) scales are the same
	for all modes. We then analyze the effect of filtering out (truncating)
	modes of low, high, and intermediate spatial frequency from this
	infinite hierarchy in the real and spectral domains. A low-frequency
	cutoff renders the truncated hierarchy homogeneous. The integral
	scales of the lowest- and highest-frequency cutoff modes are related
	to length scales of the sampling window (domain) and data support
	(sample volume), respectively. Taking the former to be proportional
	to the latter renders expressions for the integral scale and variance
	of the truncated field dependent on window and support scale (in
	a manner previously shown to be consistent with observations in the
	isotropic case). It also allows (in principle) bridging across scales
	at a specific locale, as well as among locales, by adopting either
	site-specific or generalized variogram parameters. The introduction
	of intermediate cutoffs allows us to account, in a straightforward
	manner, for lacunarity due to gaps in the multiscale hierarchy created
	by the absence of modes associated with discrete ranges of scales
	(for example, where textural and structural features are associated
	with distinct ranges of scale, such as fractures having discrete
	ranges of trace length and density, which dissect the rock into matrix
	blocks having corresponding ranges of sizes). We explore mathematically
	and graphically the effects that anisotropy and lacunarity have on
	the integral scale, variance, covariance, and spectra of a truncated
	fractal field. We then develop an expression for the equivalent hydraulic
	conductivity of a box-shaped porous block, embedded within a multiscale
	log hydraulic conductivity field, under mean-uniform flow. The block
	is larger than the support scale of the field but is smaller than
	a surrounding sampling window. Consequently, its equivalent hydraulic
	conductivity is a random variable whose variance and spatial autocorrelation
	function, conditioned on a known mean value of support-scale conductivity
	across the window, are given explicitly by our multiscale theory.}},

  title = {{Upscaling transport with mass transfer models: Mean behavior and
	propagation of uncertainty}},
  journal = {Water Resources Research},
  year = {{2009}},
  volume = {{45}},
  month = {{Oct 8}},
  abstract = {{The choice of an adequate large-scale conceptual transport model
	constitutes a major challenge associated with the upscaling of solute
	transport. Among the different alternatives to the classical advection-dispersion
	model, the (multirate) mass transfer model has been proposed as a
	valuable and convenient alternative to model the large-scale behavior
	of solute transport. This paper evaluates the use of mass transfer
	models as a constitutive equation for upscaling solute transport.
	To achieve this, we compare Monte Carlo simulations of solute transport
	at two different support scales. Transport simulations performed
	at the smallest scale represent a set of reference transport solutions
	described at a high resolution, which are contrasted against transport
	simulations obtained using an upscaled model (low resolution). Several
	formulations of the multirate mass transfer model, which differ in
	the type of memory function (single rate, double rate, and truncated
	power law), are used as a constitutive transport equation. The large-scale
	scenario represents a simplified model obtained by partially homogenizing
	the reference solution. Results show that the double-rate and the
	truncated power law mass transfer models are capable of properly
	describing the ensemble average behavior of the main features associated
	with the integrated breakthrough curves. However, the uncertainty
	associated with the upscaled mass transfer models was substantially
	smaller than that attributed to the reference solution. Importantly,
	the cumulative distribution function of concentrations associated
	with the upscaled model follows a distribution similar to the reference
	solution but with smaller statistical dispersion. The reason is that
	while appropriate memory functions can be used to preserve the residence
	time distribution of mass particles during upscaling, the lack of
	memory in space prevents the model from reproducing mass fluxes in
	all directions. Specifically, the reproduction of mass fluxes taking
	place at the interface between two homogenized blocks of the upscaled
	model is not satisfied, thus providing a poor description of the
	spatial distribution of mass particles in a given realization.}},

  abstract = {The theoretical results of part 1 [Dagan and Fiori, 2003] for modeling
	time-dependent, advective transport of a conservative solute in porous
	formations of bimodal structure are applied to illustrate the behavior
	of a few trajectory statistical moments as function of time, of the
	permeability contrast kappa, and of the inclusions volume density
	n. The computations are carried out for circular (2D) and spherical
	(3D) inclusions to represent isotropic media. Advective transport
	is solved by studying the distortion of a thin plume, linear (2D)
	or planar (3D), normal to the mean velocity U and moving through
	a single inclusion. The deformation of the plume is determined from
	the residual trajectories of solute particles that are derived numerically
	by a quadrature. The longitudinal macrodispersivity is defined by
	alphaL(t; n, kappa) = (2U)-1dX11/dt, where X11 is the trajectories
	second moment in the mean flow direction. The general behavior of
	the time-dependent longitudinal dispersivity alphaL(t; n, kappa)
	and, in particular, its constant, large time limit are examined.
	The tendency of alphaL to the ï?`½Fickianï?`½ limit with time depends
	strongly on the conductivity contrast; in particular, for low permeable
	inclusions (kappa much less than 1) it may be extremely slow. It
	is shown that the first-order approximation in the conductivity contrast
	kappa is of limited validity (0.3 < kappa < 2). The transverse moment
	X22 tends asymptotically to a constant value. The analysis of the
	trajectory high order moments shows that the probability density
	function (pdf) of the solute trajectories tends to normality at large
	time. Similar to the ï?`½Fickianï?`½ limit the normal distribution
	may be reached at very large time in presence of low conductivity

	flow and mass transport through crystalline rocks is addressed. First,
	the problem of conductivity upscaling from a highly heterogeneous
	subgrid (measurement) conductivity field to a less heterogeneous
	supragrid (model) one is studied. Secondly, the question of whether
	the intervening rock masses between major fracture zones can allow
	for a sufficient spatial homogenization of a dispersion phenomenon
	as required by invoking the ergodic hypothesis is studied. For the
	sake of this paper, it is assumed that the observed spatial variability
	of apparent conductivity data, determined by 3m double-packer tests,
	obeys a statistically isotropic and stationary lognormal random function
	in two dimensions with a logconductivity variance σ2lnK of 16. The
	result of the numerical simulations undertaken suggests that the
	upscaling of a highly heterogeneous subgrid conductivity field may
	benefit from considering the anisotropy characteristics caused by
	an insufficient homogenization of the subgrid heterogeneity on the
	scale of a supragrid model block. Concerning the spreading of a conservative
	solute the treatment was restricted to a single realization with
	a characteristic field dimension of 32λlnK, where λlnK is the logconductivity
	integral scale. The solute dispersion was studied in two orthogonal
	directions by particle tracking. Despite an isotropic logconductivity
	field, the particle tracking produces different dispersivities, which
	demonstrates that the particular realization studied was not large
	enough to provide ergodicity.},

  abstract = {{The paper provides an introduction to fundamental concepts of mathematical
	modeling of mass transport in fractured porous heterogeneous rocks.
	Keeping aside many important factors that can affect mass transport
	in subsurface, our main concern is the multi-scale character of the
	rock formation, which is constituted by porous domains dissected
	by the network of fractures. Taking into account the well-documented
	fact that porous rocks can be considered as a fractal medium and
	assuming that sizes of pores vary significantly (i.e. have different
	characteristic scales), the fractional-order differential equations
	that model the anomalous diffusive mass transport in such type of
	domains are derived and justified analytically. Analytical solutions
	of some particular problems of anomalous diffusion in the fractal
	media of various geometries are obtained. Extending this approach
	to more complex situation when diffusion is accompanied by advection,
	solute transport in a fractured porous medium is modeled by the advection-dispersion
	equation with fractional time derivative. In the case of confined
	fractured porous aquifer, accounting for anomalous non-Fickian diffusion
	in the surrounding rock mass, the adopted approach leads to introduction
	of an additional fractional time derivative in the equation for solute
	transport. The closed-form solutions for concentrations in the aquifer
	and surrounding rocks are obtained for the arbitrary time-dependent
	source of contamination located in the inlet of the aquifer. Based
	on these solutions, different regimes of contamination of the aquifers
	with different physical properties can be readily modeled and analyzed.

  abstract = {{Inverse modelling is a key step in groundwater-related hydrological
	studies. Several inversion techniques were developed during the last
	decades, but hardly any comparison between them was presented. We
	compare seven modern inverse methods for groundwater flow: the Regularised
	Pilot Points Method (both the estimation, RPPM-CE, and the Monte
	Carlo (MC) simulation variants, RPPM-CS), the MC variant of the Representer
	Method (RM), the Sequential Self-Calibration Method (SSC), the Moment

	synthetic example, depicting steady-state groundwater flow around
	a pumping well. Their relative performance is assessed in terms of
	their ability to characterise the log-transmissivity and hydraulic
	head fields and to predict the extent of the well catchment, both
	for a mildly and a strongly heterogeneous transmissivity field. The
	main conclusions drawn from the comparison are: (1) MC-based methods
	(RPPM-CS, SSC and PM) yield very similar results, regardless the
	degree of heterogeneity and despite they use different parameterisation
	schemes and objective functions; (2) statistical moments of the target
	quantities provided by MEM and RPPM-CE are similar to those of MC-based
	methods; (3) ZM and SAM are negatively affected by strong heterogeneity;
	and (4) in general, observed differences between the performances
	of all methods are not very large. MC-based inverse methods need
	considerably more CPU time than the other tested approaches. An advantage
	of MC-based methods is that they allow computing the posterior probability
	distribution of the target quantities, which can be directly fed
	to probabilistic risk-assessment procedures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  volume = {21},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {The multivariate Gaussian random function model is commonly used in
	stochastic hydrogeology to model spatial variability of log-conductivity.
	The multi-Gaussian model is attractive because it is fully characterized
	by an expected value and a covariance function or matrix, hence its
	mathematical simplicity and easy inference. Field data may support
	a Gaussian univariate distribution for log hydraulic conductivity,
	but, in general, there are not enough field data to support a multi-Gaussian
	distribution. A univariate Gaussian distribution does not imply a
	multi-Gaussian model. In fact, many multivariate models can share
	the same Gaussian histogram and covariance function, yet differ by
	their patterns of spatial continuity at different threshold values.
	Hence the decision to use a multi-Gaussian model to represent the
	uncertainty associated with the spatial heterogeneity of log-conductivity
	is not databased. Of greatest concern is the fact that a multi-Gaussian
	model implies the minimal spatial correlation of extreme values,
	a feature critical for mass transport and a feature that may be in
	contradiction with some geological settings, e.g. channeling. The
	possibility for high conductivity values to be spatially correlated
	should not be discarded by adopting a congenial model just because
	data shortage prevents refuting it. In this study, three alternatives
	to a multi-Gaussian model, all sharing the same Gaussian histogram
	and the same covariance function, but with different continuity patterns
	for extreme values, were considered to model the spatial variability
	of log-conductivity. The three alternative models, plus the traditional
	multi-Gaussian model, are used to perform Monte Carlo analyses of
	groundwater travel times from a hypothetical nuclear repository to
	the ground surface through a synthetic formation similar to the Finnsjön
	site in Sweden. The results show that the groundwater travel times
	predicted by the multi-Gaussian model could be ten times slower than
	those predicted by the other models. The probabilities of very short
	travel times could be severely underestimated using the multi-Gaussian
	model. Consequently, if field measured data are not sufficient to
	determine the higher-order moments necessary to validate the multi-Gaussian
	model — which is the usual situation in practice — other alternative
	models to the multi-Gaussian one ought to be considered.},

	(CDE), the mobile-immobile model (MIM), the convective lognormal
	transfer function model (CLT), the spatial fractional advection-dispersion
	equation (FADE) and the continuous time random walk model (CTRW).
	Each of these models was used to fit the breakthrough curve (BTC)
	at each distance individually and was also used to fit the BTCs at
	different distances simultaneously. Dependence of estimated parameters
	on distance was investigated. The estimated parameters at 200cm were
	used to make predictions at subsequent distances. Highly anomalous
	transport behavior was observed in the column as the BTCs demonstrated
	significantly irregular shape and long tailing. This study indicated
	that CDE, CLT and FADE were unable to describe the anomalous BTCs
	adequately and their parameters changed with transport distance significantly.
	Compared to CDE, CLT and FADE, MIM better captured the evolution
	of anomalous BTCs. However, MIM did not explain the distinct BTC
	tailing satisfactorily. In contrast to MIM, CTRW better simulated
	the long tails of BTCs. The spreading parameter ([beta]) of CTRW
	was close to one and remained approximately constant at different
	travel distances. To make the comparison of these five models more
	general beyond the specific transport condition in the soil column,
	a generic evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of these
	five models was presented in terms of their theory framework and
	a priori knowledge of the model behaviors.},

	Quantification of flow through these types of heterogeneities in

  pages = {102 - 114},
  abstract = {Redox processes, including degradation of organic contaminants, are
	often controlled by microorganisms residing in natural porous media
	like soils or aquifers. These environments are characterized by heterogeneities
	at various scales which influence the transport of chemical species
	and the spatial distribution of microorganisms. As a result, the
	accessibility of the chemical species by the resident microbial populations
	may be limited, altering the efficiency of the biodegradation process.
	Hence, the biodegradation rate of contaminants at large scales does
	not only depend on the degradation capacity of the indigenous microbial
	population but also on the heterogeneities of the hosting media at
	smaller scales. It is thus important to establish a link between
	effective reaction rates and various structural features of porous
	media which can be directly observed or measured. This link is urgently
	needed because explicit resolution of heterogeneities within large-scale
	reactive transport models is still limited by the available computational
	capacities. The present study introduces a reactive transport modeling
	approach to determine the influence of pore-scale heterogeneities
	on biogeochemical processes in porous media. For this purpose, a
	pore network model, which simulates flow and advective–diffusive
	transport of chemical species in heterogeneous pore networks is developed
	and coupled to the Biogeochemical Reaction Network Simulator (BRNS).
	The resulting coupled model (PNBRNS) is able to simulate the reactive
	transport of solutes in heterogeneous pore assemblies. The PNBRNS
	model is applied for the simulation of a test case of bioavailability
	and effective biodegradation rate of a dissolved contaminant in different
	pore networks, built using a discrete set of geostatistically derived
	pore-size or biomass distributions. Results show that the heterogeneity
	of the pore-size distribution has a significant impact on bioavailability
	while the heterogeneity of the biomass distribution only leads to
	minor effects. The model also includes intra-pore bioavailability
	restrictions using diffusion-limited biodegradation kinetics. The
	results indicate that intra-pore limitations lead to extra constrains
	on the biodegradation of contaminants, even in the presence of larger-scale
	structural heterogeneities.},

  abstract = {An effective streamtube ensemble method is developed to upscale convectiveï?`½dispersive
	transport with multicomponent nonlinear reactions in steady nonuniform
	flow. The transport is cast in terms of a finite ensemble of independent
	discrete streamtubes that approximate convective transport along
	macroscopically averaged pathlines and dispersive transport longitudinally
	as microscopic mixing within streamtubes. The representation of fate
	and transport via a finite ensemble of effective linear streamtubes,
	allows the treatment of arbitrarily complex reaction systems involving
	both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, and longitudinal dispersive/diffusive
	mixing within streamtubes. This allows the use of reactive-transport
	codes designed to solve such problems in an Eulerian framework, as
	opposed to reliance on closed-form (convolutional or canonical) expressions
	for reactive transport in exclusively convective streamtubes. The
	approach requires both reactive-transport solutions for a representative
	ensemble of one-dimensional convectiveï?`½dispersiveï?`½reactive
	streamtubes and the distribution of flux over the streamtube ensemble
	variants, and it does not allow for lateral mixing between streamtubes.
	Here, the only ensemble variant is travel time. The discussion details
	the way that the conventional Eulerian fate and transport model is
	converted first into an ensemble of transports along three-dimensional
	streamtubes of unknown geometry, and then to approximate one-dimensional
	streamtubes that are designed to honor the important global properties
	of the transport. Conditions under which such an ï?`½equivalentï?`½
	ensemble of one-dimensional streamtubes are described. The breakthrough
	curve of a nonreactive tracer in the ensemble is expressed as a combined
	Volterraï?`½Fredholm integral equation, which serves as the basis
	for estimation of the distribution of flux over the variant of the
	ensemble, travel time. Transient convective speed and the effects
	of errors in flux distributions are described, and the method is
	applied to a demonstration problem involving nonlinear multicomponent

  abstract = {{The geological complexity of fractured reservoirs requires the use
	of simplified models for flow simulation. This is often addressed
	in practice by using flow modeling procedures based on the dual-porosity,
	dual-permeability concept. However, in most existing approaches,
	there is not a systematic and quantitative link between the underlying
	geological model {[}in this case, a discrete fracture model (DFM)]
	and the parameters appearing in the flow model. In this work, a systematic
	upscaling procedure is presented to construct a dual-porosity, dual-permeability
	model from detailed discrete fracture characterizations. The technique,
	referred to as a multiple subregion (MSR) model, represents an extension
	of an earlier method that did not account for gravitational effects.
	The subregions (or subgrid) are constructed for each coarse block
	using the isopressure curves obtained from local pressure solutions
	of a discrete fracture model over the block. The subregions thus
	account for the fracture distribution and can represent accurately
	the matrix-matrix and matrix-fracture transfer. The matrix subregions
	are connected to matrices in vertically adjacent blocks (as in a
	dual-permeability model) to capture phase segregation caused by gravity.
	Two-block problems are solved to provide fracture-fracture flow effects.
	All connections in the coarse-scale model are characterized in terms
	of upscaled transmissibilities, and the resulting coarse model can
	be used with any connectivity-based reservoir simulator. The method
	is applied to simulate 2D and 3D fracture models, with viscous, gravitational,
	and capillary pressure effects, and is shown to provide results in
	close agreement with the underlying DFM. Speedups of approximately
	a factor of 120 are observed for a complex 3D example.}},

	a representative natural hydraulic gradient in a vertical fracture,
	breakthrough curves for variable-density systems are shown to be
	significantly different from those with constant-density conditions
	for even very small solute source concentrations (as low as approximately
	2.3 g L(-1) total dissolved solids, corresponding to 6.4\% of seawater
	salinity). We compare analytical solutions with results of fully
	coupled numerical simulations of variable-density groundwater flow
	and solute transport in fractured rock. Current analytical solutions
	for solute transport in fractured rock do not account for fluid density
	variations and therefore fail to predict variable-density transport.
	Using a mixed convection ratio analysis, we determine the hydrogeologic
	conditions where variable-density transport is important and hence
	when analytical solutions fail to predict variable-density transport
	in fractured rock. We present a modified velocity term that includes
	a density-driven flow component in a vertical fracture to account
	for fluid density variations. The modified velocity term is incorporated
	into the standard Tang et al. (1981) analytical solution. The original
	density-invariant analytical solution is shown to be applicable near
	a solute source and at early time, while the velocity-modified density-variant
	solution gives very good results for long-term and far-field behavior.
	These results suggest that analytical solutions may still be useful
	for analyzing variable-density transport in fractured rock. This

	locally homogeneous and mean flow as if it was locally uniform, one
	obtains a localized Darcian approximation {[}q(x)](c) approximate
	to -K-c(x)del{[}h(x)](c) in which K-c(x) is a space-dependent conditional
	hydraulic conductivity tensor. This leads to the traditional deterministic,
	Darcian steady state flow equation which, however, acquires a nontraditional
	meaning in that its parameters and state variables are data dependent
	and therefore inherently nonunique. It further explains why parameter
	estimates obtained by traditional inverse methods tend to vary as
	one modifies the database. Localized equations yield no information
	about predictive uncertainty. Our stochastic derivation of these
	otherwise standard deterministic flow equations makes clear that
	uncertainty measures associated with estimates of head and flux,
	obtained by traditional inverse methods, are generally smaller (often
	considerably so) than measures of corresponding predictive uncertainty,
	which can be assessed only by means of stochastic models such as
	ours. We present a detailed comparison between finite element solutions

	series we presented exact nonlocal equations for first and second
	conditional ensemble moments of hydraulic head and flux under steady
	state groundwater flow in bounded, randomly nonuniform domains in
	the presence of uncertain source and boundary terms. We derived recursive
	approximations for these equations based on expansion in powers of
	a small parameter sigma(Y), which represents the standard estimation
	error of log hydraulic conductivity; developed a two-dimensional
	finite element scheme for their solution, under the action of deterministic
	forcing terms, to first order in sigma(Y)(2); showed how to localize
	the conditional mean flow equations so as to yield familiar-looking,
	Darcian differential equations in which, however, all quantities
	are conditional on data and therefore nonunique; and proposed that
	traditional deterministic flow models be reinterpreted in light of
	these localized equations. We stressed that all quantities which
	enter into our nonlocal and localized conditional moment equations
	are defined on a consistent support scale thereby obviating the need
	for upscaling (from support to grid scale) or the a priori definition
	of a computational grid; that such a grid can therefore be defined
	a posteriori based on the degree of smoothness one expects the conditional
	moments to exhibit; and that conditioning points are often spaced
	widely enough to render these moments relatively smooth and hence
	resolvable on a coarser grid than is necessary for Monte Carlo simulations.
	This notwithstanding, we use in this paper a high-resolution grid
	to explore superimposed mean-uniform and convergent flows in unconditional
	and conditional log hydraulic conductivity domains and to compare
	the relative accuracies of corresponding nonlocal, localized, and
	Monte Carlo finite element solutions. Whereas our nonlocal solution
	is nominally restricted to mildly nonuniform media with sigma(Y)(2)
	much less than 1, we find that it actually yields remarkably accurate
	results for strongly nonuniform media with sigma(Y)(2) at least as
	large as 4. Localized solutions deteriorate relative to nonlocal
	results as one approaches some points of conditioning and singularity
	or as sigma(Y)(2) increases. Though they require much less computer
	time than do nonlocal solutions, localized solutions have the added
	disadvantage that they yield no information about predictive uncertainty.}},

  title = {Dispersion Controlled Natural Attenuation : The role of conservative
	plume characteristics in reactive mixing processes},
  school = {Universiteit Utrecht},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {The aim of this project was to gain a fundamental understanding into
	competing mixing processes involved in natural/enhanced attenuation;
	processes which occur chiefly in the transition zone of a contaminant
	plume. Analytical and numerical methods, in combination with laboratory
	and field data, were employed to quantify these mixing processes.
	In particular, the focus of this work was on transverse dispersion,
	believed to be the most important mechanism resulting in the mixing
	of electron acceptors (EA) and electron donors (ED). A new two-dimensional
	analytical solution was derived, proving conclusively that transversal
	dispersion is indeed the most important dispersion mechanism leading
	to the attenuation of steady-state contaminant plumes where species
	(e.g. EA and ED) mix and instantaneously react together. This model
	was extended generically in three-dimensions and also to further
	include anaerobic core degradation processes, which have been demonstrated
	to play an important role in some remediation cases. This occurs
	when core degradation rates are comparable to fringe degradation,
	which is often the the case when EA availability is limited. It must
	be noted that although three-dimensional solutions can be formulated,
	in practice most problems can be considered in two-dimensions. In
	another study, a numerical model was developed to access the competing
	mechanisms of transverse mixing and kinetic-controlled biodegradation
	where two species react together. The base model consisted of three
	non-linear governing partial differential equations (PDE), describing
	EA and ED migration, and moreover microbial growth, in time. These
	can be reduced to two PDE by the introduction of a new parameter
	relating concentrations of EA and ED to each other. The PDE describing
	this variable can be solved using an appropriate "intermediate" analytical
	solution. In the steady-state, the equations reduce to just one PDE,
	in terms of one variable, requiring a numerical solution. The new
	model provides an elegant solution to the problem and agrees excellently
	with the base model. Furthermore, the new model allows an easy assessment
	of the effects of interacting dispersion and reaction parameters
	on plume development. The value of longitudinal dispersivity is paramount
	to provide an accurate solution, whilst transversal dispersivity
	and microbial growth control fringe width and the attenuation capacity
	of contaminant plumes. The combination of these effects can be seen
	as `effective' dispersion. In another study, a model-based interpretation
	of laboratory scale experimental data was undertaken. It was demonstrated
	that the classical form of the dispersion coefficient does not hold
	at the laboratory scale, when plumes of reacting species are considered.
	Using a new empirical formula combined with derived diffusion coefficients,
	the laboratory data could be accurately simulated using pure forward
	modelling techniques. In the last exercise, the analytical model
	derived in a previous study was applied to field data for a well
	documented petroleum hydrocarbon plume. The plume consists of a non-reactive
	benzene plume and a steady-state, reactive toluene plume. Extracting
	parameters from data profiles for conservative species, it was possible
	to accurately predict plume lengths of the reactive hydrocarbon plume.
	The results of these studies provide useful modelling tools, particulary
	in the assessment of studies in monitored natural attenuation.},

	with the physical process of dispersion. The forms of the moment-generating
	equations for different mass transfer models provide insight into
	reactive transport through heterogeneous aquifers. For the mass transfer
	models we considered, the zeroth moment in a heterogeneous aquifer
	is independent of the mass transfer coefficients. Thus, if the velocity
	field is known, the mass transported past any point, or out any boundary,
	can be calculated without knowledge of the spatial pattern of mass
	transfer coefficients and, in fact, without knowledge of whether
	mass transfer is occurring. Also, for both first-order and diffusive
	mass transfer models, the mean arrival time depends on the distribution
	coefficient but is independent of the values of the rate coefficients,
	regardless of the spatial variability of groundwater velocity and
	mass transfer coefficients.},

  abstract = {Bioavailability often controls the fate of organic contaminants in
	surface and subsurface aquatic environments. Bioavailability can
	be limited by sorption, mass transfer, and intrinsic biodegradation
	potential and can be further altered by the presence of other compounds.
	This paper reviews current perspectives on the processes influencing
	subsurface contaminant bioavailability, how these processes are modeled,
	and how the relative role of the various processes can be assessed
	through bioavailability indices. Although these processes are increasingly
	well understood, the use of sophisticated models and indices often
	are precluded by an inability to estimate the many parameters that
	are associated with complex models. Nonetheless, the proper representation
	of sorption, mass transfer, biodegradation, and co-solute effects
	can be critical in predicting bio-attenuation. The influence of these
	processes on contaminant fate is illustrated with numerical simulations
	for the simultaneous degradation of toluene (growth substrate) and
	trichloroethylene (nongrowth cometabolite) in hypothetical, aerobic,
	solid-water systems. The results show how the relative impacts on
	contaminant fate of the model's various component processes depends
	upon system conditions, including co-solute concentrations. Slow
	biodegradation rates increase the inhibition effects of a cometabolite
	and suppress the rate enhancement effects of a growth substrate.
	Irrespective of co-solute effects, contaminant fate is less sensitive
	to biodegradation processes in systems with strong sorption and slow
	desorption rates. Bioavailability indices can be used to relate these
	findings and to help identify appropriate modeling simplifications.
	In general, however, there remains a need to redefine such indices
	in order that bioavailability concepts can be better incorporated
	into site characterization, remediation design, and regulatory oversight.},

	a nonlinear geostatistical inverse algorithm for steady state flow
	that makes it possible to further condition such analyses on measured
	values of state variables. Our approach accounts for all scales of
	spatial variability resolvable by the computational grid. It is based
	on recursive finite element approximations of exact nonlocal first
	and second conditional moment equations. Hydraulic conductivity is
	parameterized geostatistically on the basis of measured values at
	discrete locations and unknown values at discrete ``pilot points.''
	Prior estimates of pilot point values are obtained (optionally) by
	generalized kriging. Posterior estimates at pilot points and (optionally)
	at measurement points are obtained by calibrating mean flow against
	measured values of head. The parameters are projected onto a computational
	grid via kriging. Maximum likelihood calibration allows estimating
	not only hydraulic but also (optionally) unknown variogram parameters
	with or without prior information about the former. The approach
	yields covariance matrices for parameter estimation as well as head
	and flux prediction errors, the latter being obtained a posteriori.
	We implement our inverse approach on highly and mildly heterogeneous
	media under superimposed mean uniform and convergent flows in a bounded
	two-dimensional domain. Our examples illustrate how conductivity
	and head data act separately and jointly to reduce parameter estimation
	errors and to model predictive uncertainty. We also evaluate the

	field effectively describes a field with a high degree of variability
	to satisfy the one-point statistics of Levy-stable distribution and
	the two-point statistics of fractional Levy motion (fLm). To overcome
	the difficulty of using infinite variance of Levy-stable distribution
	and to provide the physical meaning of a finite domain in real space,
	truncated power variograms are utilized for the fLm fields. The fLm
	model is general in the sense that both stationary and commonly used
	fractional Brownian motion (fBm) models are its special cases. When
	the upper cutoff of the truncated power variogram is close to the
	lower cutoff, the stationary model is well approximated. The commonly
	used fBm model is recovered when the Levy index of fLm is 2. Flow
	and solute transport were analyzed using the first-order perturbation
	method. Mean velocity, velocity covariance, and effective hydraulic
	conductivity in a three-dimensional fractal random field were derived.
	Analytical results for particle displacement covariance and macrodispersion
	coefficients are also presented. The results show that the plume
	in an fLm field moves slower at early time and has more significant
	long-tailing behavior at late time than in fBm or stationary exponential
	fields. The proposed fractal transport model has broader applications
	than those of stationary and fBm models. Flow and solute transport
	can be simulated for various scenarios by adjusting the Levy index

	and may originate from different sources. The aim of this study was
	to determine whether stable carbon isotope ratios remain constant
	during dissolution and transport of chlorinated ethenes and whether
	the ratios can be used to link plumes to their sources. Detailed
	depth-discrete delineation of the carbon isotope ratio in a tetrachloroethene
	(PCE) plume and in a trichloroethene (TCE) plume was done along cross-sections
	orthogonal to groundwater flow in two sandy aquifers in the Province
	of Ontario, Canada. At the TCE site, TCE concentrations up to solubility
	were measured in one high concentration zone close to the bottom
	of the aquifer from where dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL)
	was collected. A laboratory experiment using the DNAPL indicated
	that only very small carbon isotope fractionation occurs during dissolution
	of TCE (0.26parts per thousand), which is consistent with field observations.
	At most sampling points, the delta(13)C of dissolved TCE was similar
	to that of the DNAPL except for a few sampling points at the bottom
	of the aquifer close to the underlying aquitard. At these points,
	a C-13 enrichment of up to 2.4parts per thousand was observed, which
	was likely due to biodegradation and possibly preferential diffusion
	of TCE with C-12 into the aquitard. In contrast to the TCE site,
	several distinct zones of high concentration were observed at the
	PCE site and from zones to zone, the delta(13)C values varied substantially
	from -24.3parts per thousand to -33.6parts per thousand. Comparison
	of the delta(13)C values in the high concentration zones made it
	possible to divide the plume in the three different domains, each
	probably representing a different episode and location of DNAPL release.
	The three different zones could still be distinguished 220 m from
	the DNAPL sources. This demonstrates that carbon isotope ratios can
	be used to differentiate between different zones in chlorinated ethene
	plumes and to link plume zones to their sources. In addition, subtle
	variations in delta(13)C at plume fringes provided insight into mechanisms
	of plume spreading in transverse vertical direction. These variations
	were identified because of the high-resolution provided by the monitoring
	network. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

	Discrete-fracture models can be formulated in a lower-dimensional

	the matrix have the same dimension. When the velocity of the flow

	for expanding lower-dimensional fractures and we compare two different

  title = {Flow and transport in highly heterogeneous formations: 3. Numerical
	simulations and comparison with theoretical results},

  abstract = {In parts 1 [Dagan et al., 2003] and 2 [Fiori et al., 2003] a multi-indicator
	model of heterogeneous formations is devised in order to solve flow
	and transport in highly heterogeneous formations. The isotropic medium
	is made up from circular (2-D) or spherical (3-D) inclusions of different
	conductivities K, submerged in a matrix of effective conductivity.
	This structure is different from the multi-Gaussian one, even for
	equal log conductivity distribution and integral scale. A snapshot
	of a two-dimensional plume in a highly heterogeneous medium of lognormal
	conductivity distribution shows that the model leads to a complex
	transport picture. The present study was limited, however, to investigating
	the statistical moments of ergodic plumes. Two approximate semianalytical
	solutions, based on a self-consistent model (SC) and on a first-order
	perturbation in the log conductivity variance (FO), are used in parts
	1 and 2 in order to compute the statistical moments of flow and transport
	variables for a lognormal conductivity pdf. In this paper an efficient
	and accurate numerical procedure, based on the analytic-element method
	[Strack, 1989], is used in order to validate the approximate results.
	The solution satisfies exactly the continuity equation and at high-accuracy
	the continuity of heads at inclusion boundaries. The dimensionless
	dependent variables depend on two parameters: the volume fraction
	n of inclusions in the medium and the log conductivity variance sigmaY2.
	For inclusions of uniform radius, the largest n was 0.9 (2-D) and
	0.7 (3-D), whereas the largest sigmaY2 was equal to 10. The SC approximation
	underestimates the longitudinal Eulerian velocity variance for increasing
	n and increasing sigmaY2 in 2-D and, to a lesser extent, in 3-D,
	as compared to numerical results. The FO approximation overestimates
	these variances, and these effects are larger in the transverse direction.
	The longitudinal velocity pdf is highly skewed and negative velocities
	are present at high sigmaY2, especially in 2-D. The main results
	are in the comparison of the macrodispersivities, computed with the
	aid of the Lagrangian velocity covariances, as functions of travel
	time. For the longitudinal macrodispersivity, the SC approximation
	yields results close to the numerical ones in 2-D for n = 0.4 but
	underestimates them for n = 0.9. The asymptotic, large travel time
	values of macrodispersivities in the SC and FO approximations are
	close for low to moderate sigmaY2, as shown and explained in part
	1. However, while the slow tendency to Fickian behavior is well reproduced
	by SC, it is much quicker in the FO approximation. In 3-D the SC
	approximation is closer to numerical one for the highest n = 0.7
	and the different sigmaY2 = 2, 4, 8, and the comparison improves
	if molecular diffusion is taken into account. Transverse macrodispersivity
	for small travel times is underestimated by SC in 2-D and is closer
	to numerical results in 3-D, whereas FO overestimates them. Transverse
	macrodispersivity asymptotically tends to zero in 2-D for large travel
	times. In 3-D the numerical simulations lead to a small but persistent
	transverse macrodispersivity for large travel times, whereas it tends
	to zero in the approximate solutions. The results suggest that the
	self-consistent semianalytical approximation provides a valuable
	tool to model transport in highly heterogeneous isotropic formations
	of a 3-D structure in terms of trajectories statistical moments.
	It captures effects like slow transition to Fickian behavior and
	to Gaussian trajectory distribution, which are neglected by the first-order
	approximation.},

	biodegradation in heterogeneous aquifers applying the stochastic-convective
	and the advective-dispersive stream tube approaches, in which we
	use a semianalytical traveling wave solution for one-dimensional

	is an efficient and accurate way to evaluate the development of intrastream

	stream tube approach is suitable to describe nonlinear bioreactive
	transport in systems controlled by local-scale dispersion. In contrast
	with conservative transport the mean contaminant flux is shown to
	be significantly influenced by transverse dispersion, even for realistic
	Peclet values. Furthermore, asymptotic front shapes are shown to
	be neither Fickian nor constant (traveling wave behavior), which
	raises questions about the current practice of upscaling bioreactive
	transport. The error caused by neglecting local dispersion was found
	to increase with time and to remain significant even for large retardation
	differences between electron acceptor and contaminant. This implies
	that, even if reaction rates are dominated by chromatographic mixing,
	the dispersive mixing process cannot be disregarded when predicting

	in deep geological media has fostered the development of efficient
	numerical models of groundwater flow and contaminant transport in
	fractured media. These models usually account for water flow through
	fracture zones embedded in a 3D rock matrix continuum. The first
	formulation of fractures in groundwater flow finite element models
	was proposed by Kiraly, and later revisited and generalized by Perrochet.
	From a mathematical viewpoint, fractures can be considered as in-dimensional
	manifolds in an n-dimensional Euclidean space (mless than or equal
	ton). The key step of this formulation ties in an expression relating
	the hypersurface element dS(m) to the infinitesimal local co-ordinates
	dzeta(i) (i = 1,...,m). Here we present a novel proof for this relation
	using a different approach to that of Perrochet, and explore the
	efficiency and accuracy of the formulation. It is shown that the
	aforementioned relation leads to a general and compact formulation
	which is not only applicable to elements of any dimension (e.g. 1D,
	2D and 3D elements in a 3D domain), but also overcomes the cumbersome
	and case-specific calculations of traditional approaches. This formulation
	has been implemented in a versatile finite clement program for modelling
	groundwater flow, solute transport and heat transport in porous and
	fractured media. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed formulation
	has been analysed using a synthetic case dealing with flow and solute
	transport through a 2D fractured rock block. The proposed formulation,
	in which fractures are discretized by means of 1D elements is more
	efficient and accurate than the traditional finite element formulation
	of discretizing fractures by means of 2D elements. The capability
	of the proposed formulation to cope with complex systems is illustrated
	with a case study of groundwater flow induced by the construction
	of the access tunnel to ail underground research laboratory in Aspo
	(Sweden). The numerical model is able to reproduce the observed records
	of water levels in boreholes and flow rates into the tunnel. Although
	the proposed formulation has been implemented and tested within the
	framework of groundwater flow and solute transport in fractured porous
	media, it should be of interest for other boundary value problems.

	a number of nonisotopically sensitive steps preceding the isotopically

	flow occurs through the fracture network. The methodology developed
	here introduces local subgrids to resolve dynamics within the matrix
	and provides appropriate coarse-scale parameters describing fracture-fracture,
	matrix-fracture, and matrix-matrix flow. The geometry of the local
	subgrids, as well as the required parameters for the coarse-scale
	model, are determined from local flow solutions using the underlying
	discrete fracture model. The method is applied to two- and three-dimensional
	single-phase and two- phase flow problems, and the accuracy of the
	coarse models is assessed relative to fully resolved discrete fracture
	simulations. For the cases considered, it is shown that the technique
	is capable of generating highly accurate coarse models with many

	identified during the nutrient-rich and nutrient-depleted conditions

	of the porous micromodel decreased as a result of biomass accumulation
	in pore bodies and pore throats. In phase II, starvation conditions

	in slower growth of the biofilm causing the permeability to reach
	a minimum as all the remaining nutrients were consumed. In phase

	are selected and their parameters are established by using all available
	information, including measurements of hydraulic head and permeability.
	Second, linear estimation theory is applied to provide minimum variance

	Structure identification is achieved iteratively in three substeps:
	structure selection, maximum likelihood estimation, and model validation
	and diagnostic checking. The methodology was extensively tested through
	simulations on a simple one-dimensional case. The results are remarkably
	stable and well behaved. The estimated field is smooth, while small-scale

	improves, the procedure reproduces more features of the original

	The indicators of flow connectivity and one of the transport connectivity

	None of the statistical indicators correlate with the flow and transport

  abstract = {Recent studies indicate that during in situ bioremediation of contaminated

	zones. Classical reactive-transport models overpredict the amount
	of degradation because solute spreading and mixing are not distinguished.
	Efforts to correct this have focused on modifying both dispersion
	and reaction terms, but no consensus on the best approach has emerged.
	In this work, a pore-scale model was used to simulate degradation
	along a transverse mixing zone between two required nutrients, and
	a continuum model with fitted parameters was used to match degradation
	rates from the pore-scale model. The pore-scale model solves for
	the flow field, concentration field, and biomass development within
	pore spaces of porous medium. For the continuum model, the flow field
	and biomass distributions are assumed to be homogeneous, and the
	fitting parameters are the transverse dispersion coefficient (DT)
	and maximum substrate utilization rate (kS,c). Results from the pore-scale
	model show that degradation rates near the system inlet are limited
	by the reaction rate, while degradation rates downgradient are limited
	by transverse mixing. For the continuum model, the value of DT may
	be adjusted so that the degradation rate with distance matches that
	from the pore-scale model in the mixing-limited region. However,
	adjusting the value of kS only improves the fit to pore-scale results
	within the reaction-limited region. Comparison with field and laboratory
	experiments suggests that the length of the reaction rate-limited
	region is small compared to the length scale over which degradation
	occurs. This indicates that along transverse mixing zones in the
	field, values of kS are unimportant and only the value of DT must
	be accurately fit.  2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	widely recognized as a serious environmental problem. Predicting
	the dissolution, fate, and transport of these organic chemicals in
	the subsurface is challenging because geological heterogeneity exists
	at numerous scales. To better understand heterogeneity at the pore
	scale, we use the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method to simulate water
	flow and solute transport from distributed NAPL blobs in a two-dimensional
	porous media. The LB method approximates the momentum and mass transport
	equations at the pore scale, easily incorporating complex boundary
	conditions of the porous media. The effects of NAPL blob configuration
	and Peclet number (Pe) on steady state mass transfer are studied
	at 7\% and 15\% NAPL saturation. We find that the solute flux out
	of the simulated system decreases substantially as the transverse
	length over which NAPL blobs are distributed decreases; for example,
	the solute flux is reduced by a factor of 2 by confining the NAPL
	blobs to only half of the transverse length. Values of Sherwood numbers
	determined from our simulations are slightly less than values determined
	from previously published mass transfer correlations. Our results
	indicate that pore-scale NAPL configuration significantly affects
	mass transfer and that correlations should be modified to account
	for it. We find that the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient
	increases with Pe for the values used in our simulations, where the
	rate of increase decreases with increasing Pe. We observe that much
	of the variability in computed mass transfer coefficients is accounted
	for by differences in the NAPL-water interfacial area at high Pe.
	However, at lower Pe, variability remains due to NAPL configuration.

  abstract = {{We analyze and compare the efficiency and accuracy of two simulation
	methods for homogeneous random fields with multiscale resolution.
	We consider in particular the Fourier-wavelet method and three variants
	of the Randomization method: (A) without any stratified sampling
	of wavenumber space, (B) with stratified sampling of wavenumbers
	with equal energy subdivision, (C) with stratified sampling with
	a logarithmically uniform subdivision. We focus primarily on fractal
	Gaussian random fields with Kolmogorov-type spectra. Previous work
	has shown that variants (A) and (B) of the Randomization method are
	only able to generate a self-similar structure function over three
	to four decades with reasonable computational effort. By contrast,
	variant (C), along with the Fourier-wavelet method, is able to reproduce
	accurate self-similar scaling of the structure function over a number
	of decades increasing linearly with computational effort (for our
	examples we will show that nine decades can be reproduced). We provide
	some conceptual and numerical comparison of the various cost contributions
	to each random field simulation method. We find that when evaluating
	ensemble-averaged quantities like the correlation and structure functions,
	as well as some multi-point statistical characteristics, the Randomization
	method can provide good accuracy with less cost than the Fourier-wavelet
	method. The cost of the Randomization method relative to the Fourier-wavelet
	method, however, appears to increase with the complexity of the random
	field statistics which are to be calculated accurately. Moreover,
	the Fourier-wavelet method has better ergodic properties, and hence
	becomes more efficient for the computation of spatial (rather than
	ensemble) averages which may be important in simulating the solutions
	to partial differential equations with random field coefficients.

  journal = {Water Resources Research},
  year = {{2008}},
  volume = {{44}},
  number = {{7}},
  month = {{Jul 8}},
  abstract = {{During the last decade, isotopic fractionation has gained acceptance
	as an indicator of microbiological and chemical transformations of
	contaminants in groundwater. These transformation processes typically
	favor isotopically light, compared to isotopically heavy, contaminants,
	resulting in enrichment of the latter in the residual aqueous phase.
	In these isotope applications, it has been generally presumed that
	physical transport processes in groundwater have a negligible effect
	on isotopic enrichment. It is well known, however, that aqueous phase
	diffusion generally proceeds faster for isotopically light, compared
	to isotopically heavy, solute molecules, often resulting in isotopic
	fractionation in groundwater. This paper considers the potential
	for isotopic fractionation during transport in groundwater resulting
	from minute isotopic effects on aqueous diffusion coefficients. Analyses
	of transport in heterogeneous systems delimit the viable range of
	isotopic fractionation by diffusion in groundwater. Results show
	that diffusion can result in similar degrees of depletion and enrichment
	of isotopically heavy solutes during transport in heterogeneous systems
	with significant diffusion rate - limited mass transfer between fast-
	and slow-flow zones. Additional analyses and examples explore conditions
	that attenuate the development of significant fractionation. Examples
	are presented for (13)C methyl tertiary butyl ether and deuterated
	and nondeuterated isopropanol and tertiary butyl alcohol using aqueous
	diffusion coefficients measured by the Taylor dispersion method with
	refractive index profiling as a part of this study. Examples elucidate
	the potential for diffusive fractionation as a confounder in isotope
	applications and emphasize the importance of hydrogeologic analysis
	for assessing the role of diffusive fractionation in isotope applications

  abstract = {{1. Phreatic ecosystems (saturated groundwater ecosystems in porous
	and fractured-rock aquifers) are research frontiers for freshwater
	ecology. Many ecological issues that have been explored at length
	in surface-water and hyporheic systems are unexplored in phreatic
	systems. Phreatic ecology is currently dominated by observational
	studies rather than experiments and focuses on pattern-detection
	and description, rather than hypothesis-testing and mechanistic explanations.
	These are characteristics of science disciplines in early developmental
	stages. 2. Progress in phreatic ecology has been impeded by logistical
	problems including poor access, limited information about ecosystem
	boundaries and spatial heterogeneity, a lack of detailed habitat
	templates, limited taxonomic and biogeographic knowledge and the
	difficulties of field experiments. Each of these problems is assessed
	in this review, along with analytical techniques, instruments and
	concepts that may help researchers overcome them. 3. Access to undisturbed
	phreatic systems is generally limited to narrow zones around wells.
	Limited access and sparse well arrays make detecting ecological patterns
	and relationships and delineating ecosystem boundaries difficult.
	Spatial resolution can be increased by installing wells in configurations
	suited to specific research topics; geostatistical methods are available
	for positioning new wells and optimising interpolation between them.
	4. Phreatic systems are characterised by multi-scaled spatial and
	temporal heterogeneity. Lithofacies aggregations, buried fluvial
	bedforms, rock fractures and other geomorphic elements create structural
	and hydraulic heterogeneity, which lead in turn to spatial variation
	in solutes, biota and biogeochemical processes. The structural and
	hydraulic heterogeneity of study areas can be characterised and mapped
	with geophysical surveys and groundwater flow models. These models
	can help to identify flowpaths, recharge zones and aquifer boundaries
	and provide ecologically relevant hydrological variables. 5. Physical
	habitat templates and classifications are needed to explain variation
	in phreatic populations and communities. A candidate classification
	system is proposed, based on environmental factors that govern the
	distribution and quality of groundwater habitats: climate, lithology,
	aquifer, confinement, recharge, hydrofacies and flowpath. 6. Many
	phreatic species and higher-level taxa remain undescribed, and the
	taxonomic resolution used in phreatic ecology studies is generally
	coarse. These problems impede progress in community ecology, biogeography
	and conservation biology. DNA barcoding and other molecular taxonomy
	methods are now being applied to groundwater fauna. Combining molecular
	taxonomy and traditional morphological methods could increase the
	accuracy and efficiency of species identification and help to define
	taxonomic boundaries. 7. Field experiments and mensurative studies
	are rarely used in phreatic ecology, but they are needed to detect
	spatial and temporal patterns, quantify ecological relationships
	and test hypotheses and classification systems. Techniques from groundwater
	remediation and recharge studies can be adapted to ecological field
	experiments that utilise natural aquifer structures and groundwater
	flow dynamics.}},

	for the next-scale (medium-length) calculation. The effective matrix
	permeability associated with medium-length fractures is numerically
	solved using a boundary element method. The long fractures are modeled

  abstract = {Geochemical reaction rate laws are often measured using crushed minerals
	in well-mixed laboratory systems that are designed to eliminate mass
	transport limitations. Such rate laws are often used directly in
	reactive transport models to predict the reaction and transport of
	chemical species in consolidated porous media found in subsurface
	environments. Due to the inherent heterogeneities of porous media,
	such use of lab-measured rate laws may introduce errors, leading
	to a need to develop methods for upscaling reaction rates. In this
	work, we present a methodology for using pore-scale network modeling
	to investigate scaling effects in geochemical reaction rates. The
	reactive transport processes are simulated at the pore scale, accounting
	for heterogeneities of both physical and mineral properties. Mass
	balance principles are then used to calculate reaction rates at the
	continuum scale. To examine the scaling behavior of reaction kinetics,
	these continuum-scale rates from the network model are compared to

	rate laws and ignoring pore-scale heterogeneities. In this work,
	this methodology is demonstrated by upscaling anorthite and kaolinite
	reaction rates under simulation conditions relevant to geological

	with CO2 present at high concentrations, pore-scale concentrations
	of reactive species and reaction rates vary spatially by orders of
	magnitude, and the scaling effect is significant. With a much smaller
	CO2 concentration, the scaling effect is relatively small. These

	sequestration can generate conditions for which proper scaling tools
	are yet to be developed. This work demonstrates the use of pore-scale

	of geochemical kinetics. The pore-scale model allows the effects
	of pore-scale heterogeneities to be integrated into system behavior
	at multiple scales, thereby identifying important factors that contribute
	to the scaling effect.},

  abstract = {The possibility that gradients in concentration may develop within
	single pores and fractures, potentially giving rise to scale-dependent
	mineral dissolution rates, was investigated with experimentally validated
	reactive transport modeling. Three important subsurface mineral phases
	that dissolve at widely different rates, calcite, plagioclase, and
	iron hydroxide, were considered. Two models for analyzing mineral
	dissolution kinetics within a single pore were developed: (1) a Poiseuille
	Flow model that applies laboratory-measured dissolution kinetics
	at the pore or fracture wall and couples this to a rigorous treatment
	of both advective and diffusive transport within the pore, and (2)
	a Well-Mixed Reactor model that assumes complete mixing within the
	pore, while maintaining the same reactive surface area, average flow
	rate, geometry, and multicomponent chemistry as the Poiseuille Flow
	model. For the case of a single fracture, a 1D Plug Flow Reactor
	model was also considered to quantify the effects of longitudinal
	versus transverse mixing. Excellent agreement was obtained between
	results from the Poiseuille Flow model and microfluidic laboratory
	experiments in which pH 4 and 5 solutions were flowed through a single
	500 μm diameter by 4000 μm long cylindrical pore in calcite. The
	numerical modeling and time scale analysis indicated that rate discrepancies
	arise primarily where concentration gradients develop under two necessary
	conditions: (1) comparable rates of reaction and advective transport,
	and (2) incomplete mixing via molecular diffusion. For plagioclase
	and iron hydroxide, the scaling effects are negligible at the single
	pore and fracture scale because of their slow rates. In the case
	of calcite, where dissolution rates are rapid, scaling effects can
	develop at high flow rates from 0.1 to 1000 cm/s and for fracture
	lengths less than 1 cm. Under more normal flow conditions where flow
	is usually slower than 0.001 cm/s, however, mixing via molecular
	diffusion is effective in homogenizing the concentration field, thus
	eliminating any discrepancies between the Poiseuille Flow and the
	Well-Mixed Reactor model. The analysis suggests that concentration
	gradients are unlikely to develop within single pores and fractures
	under typical geological/hydrologic conditions, implying that the
	discrepancy between laboratory and field rates must be attributed
	to other factors.},

  abstract = {A new reactive transport modelling approach and examples of its application
	are presented, dealing with the impact of sorption/desorption kinetics
	on the spreading of solutes, e.g. organic contaminants, in groundwater.
	Slow sorption/desorption is known from the literature to be strongly
	responsible for the retardation of organic contaminants. The modelling
	concept applied in this paper quantifies sorption/desorption kinetics
	by an intra-particle diffusion approach. According to this idea,
	solute uptake by or release from the aquifer material is modelled
	at small scale by a ï?`½slowï?`½ diffusion process where the diffusion
	coefficient is reduced as compared to the aqueous diffusion coefficient
	due to (i) the size and shape of intra-particle pores and (ii) retarded
	transport of solutes within intra-particle pores governed by a nonlinear
	sorption isotherm. This process-based concept has the advantage of
	requiring only measurable model parameters, thus avoiding fitting
	parameters like first-order rate coefficients. In addition, the approach
	presented here allows for modelling of slow sorption/desorption in
	lithologically nonuniform media. Therefore, it accounts for well-known
	experimental findings indicating that sorptive properties depend
	on (i) the grain size distribution of the aquifer material and (ii)
	the lithological composition (e.g. percentage of quartz, sandstone,
	limestone, etc.) of each grain size fraction. The small-scale physico-chemical
	model describing sorption/desorption is coupled to a large-scale
	model of groundwater flow and solute transport. Consequently, hydraulic
	heterogeneities may also be considered by the overall model. This
	coupling is regarded as an essential prerequisite for simulating
	field-scale scenarios which will be addressed by a forthcoming publication.
	This paper focuses on mathematical model formulation, implementation
	of the numerical code and lab-scale model applications highlighting
	the sorption and desorption behavior of an organic contaminant (Phenanthrene)
	with regard to three lithocomponents exhibiting different sorptive
	properties. In particular, it is shown that breakthrough curves (BTCs)
	for lithologically nonuniform media cannot be obtained via simple
	arithmetic averaging of breakthrough curves for lithologically uniform
	media. In addition, as no analytical solutions are available for
	model validation purposes, simulation results are compared to measurements
	from lab-scale column experiments. The model results indicate that
	the new code can be regarded as a valuable tool for predicting long-term
	contaminant uptake or release, which may last for several hundreds
	of years for some lithocomponents. In particular, breakthrough curves
	simulated by pure forward modelling reproduce experimental data much
	better than a calibrated standard first-order kinetics reactive transport
	model, thus indicating that the new approach is of high quality and
	may be advantageously used for supporting the design of remediation
	strategies at contaminated sites where some lithocomponents and/or
	grain size classes may provide a long-term pollutant source.},

  year = {2005},
  volume = {41},
  number = {12},
  abstract = {The finite maximum length of a steady state contaminant plume is determined
	by developing and employing a new analytical solution which overcomes
	two drawbacks associated with existing approaches. First, we account
	for a sharp front caused by the complete consumption of the pollutant
	(ï?`½electron donorï?`½) and some electron acceptor in an instantaneous
	binary reaction occurring at the front. This approach is not based
	on purely conservative or first-order degradation models which lead
	to theoretically infinite plumes and, in addition, depend on a concentration
	threshold. Second, a vertical aquifer cross section with finite thickness
	is selected as a model in order to better represent the supply of
	electron acceptors mostly entering the aquifer from the top. This
	type of setting allows investigation of the impact of aquifer thickness
	on plume length. An implicit representation of the donor-acceptor
	front in a finite vertical domain previously required numerical solutions
	of the underlying advection-dispersion-reaction equation; we provide
	for the first time an analytical solution of this two-dimensional
	transport problem. The length of the plume is found to be given by
	the point of intersection of the donor-acceptor front and the aquifer
	bottom. Furthermore, a rather simple and highly accurate approximation
	is derived to compute the steady state plume length. A comprehensive
	sensitivity analysis reveals that results are most strongly influenced
	by aquifer thickness, followed by vertical transverse dispersivity
	and, to a somewhat lesser extent, by chemical reaction parameters.
	Longitudinal dispersivity has practically no effect on plume length,
	and furthermore, there is zero impact of linear velocity. With regard
	to groundwater risk assessment at the field scale it is also important
	to note that the present approach is meant to provide an upper bound
	on the actual plume length. Further research activities may be directed
	to refine the transport model by considering, for instance, degradation
	inside the plume and the limited vertical extent of the contaminant
	source.},

	A non-zero matrix diffusion factor results in a -3/2 slope of the

	fractured rock, and the matrix diffusion coefficient is a key parameter
	for describing this process. Previous studies have indicated that
	the effective rnatrix diffusion coefficient values, obtained from
	a large number of field tracer tests, are enhanced in comparison
	with local values and may increase with test scale. In this study,
	we have performed numerical experiments to investigate potential
	mechanisms behind possible scale-dependent behavior. The focus of
	the experiments is on solute transport in flow paths having geometries
	consistent with percolation theories and characterized by multiple
	local flow loops formed mainly by small-scale fractures. The water
	velocity distribution through a flow path was determined using discrete
	fracture network flow simulations, and solute transport was calculated
	using a previously derived impulse-response function and a particle-tracking
	scheme. Values for effective (or up-scaled) transport parameters
	were obtained by matching breakthrough curves from numerical experiments
	with an analytical solution for solute transport along a single fracture.
	Results indicate that a combination of local flow loops and the associated
	matrix diffusion process, together with scaling properties in flow
	path geometry, seems to be an important mechanism causing the observed
	scale dependence of the effective rnatrix diffusion coefficient (at
	a range of scales). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

	because the impact of a decay process is relatively easy to analyze.
	Several illustrative examples are presented, which show that the

	Several concepts to explain the development of biofilm structures
	have been proposed. We believe that biofilm structure formation depends
	on physical as well as general and specific biological factors. The
	physical factors (e.g. governing substrate transport) as well as
	general biological factors such as growth yield and substrate conversion
	rates are the basic factors governing structure formation. Specific
	strain dependent factors will modify these, giving a further variation
	between different biofilm systems. Biofilm formation seems to be
	primarily dependent on the interaction between mass transport and
	conversion processes. When a biofilm is strongly diffusion limited
	it will tend to become a heterogeneous and porous structure. When
	the conversion is the rate-limiting step, the biofilm will tend to
	become homogenous and compact. On top of these two processes, detachment
	processes play a significant role. In systems with a high detachment
	(or shear) force, detachment will be in the form of erosion, giving
	smoother biofilms. Systems with a low detachment force tend to give
	a more porous biofilm and detachment occurs mainly by sloughing.
	Biofilm structure results from the interplay between these interactions
	(mass transfer, conversion rates, detachment forces) making it difficult
	to study systems taking only one of these factors into account.},

	the flow in the matrix is governed by the usual Darcy law for porous
	media, with the fractures being treated as planar sources embedded
	in the matrix. The flow in an individual fracture is governed by
	a two-dimensional Darcy law (as in a Hele-Shaw cell), with an associated
	planar sink distribution. The essential feature of this approach
	is that the fractures are treated as special planes rather than narrow-gap
	voids. The error in the resulting system of equations is on the order
	of an intrinsic dimensionless parameter (the ratio of the fracture
	gap size to the scale of the volume under consideration). We also
	describe how we adapt the new model to compute effective grid block
	permeabilities. This was the principal motivation behind the development
	of the new model. Using effective grid block permeabilities to model
	flow in fractured oil and gas reservoirs is a much more efficient

	and identifying the best among them has traditionally been done with
	the aid of information theoretic or Bayesian model selection criteria.
	There is an ongoing debate in the literature about the relative merits
	of these various criteria. We contribute to this discussion by using
	synthetic data to compare the abilities of two common Bayesian criteria,
	BIC and KIC, to discriminate between alternative models of drift
	as a function of sample size when drift and variogram parameters
	are unknown. Adopting the results of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations

	provides consistently more reliable indications of model quality

	often cause analysts to replace the observed Fisher information matrix
	entering into KIC with its expected value. Our results show that
	this causes the performance of KIC to deteriorate with diminishing

	realizations of uncertain data entering into our analysis. Bayesian
	theory indicates that, in the case of statistically independent and

  abstract = {The relevant velocity that describes transport phenomena in a porous
	medium is the pore velocity. For this reason, one needs not only
	to describe the variability of transmissivity, which fully determines
	the Darcy velocity field for given source terms and boundary conditions,
	but also any variability of the pore volume. We demonstrate that
	hydraulically equivalent media with exactly the same transmissivity
	field can produce dramatic differences in the displacement of a solute
	if they have different pore volume distributions. In particular,
	we demonstrate that correlation between pore volume and transmissivity
	leads to a much smoother and more homogeneous solute distribution.
	This was observed in a laboratory experiment performed in artificial
	fractures made of two plexiglass plates into which a space-dependent
	aperture distribution was milled. Using visualization by a light
	transmission technique, we observe that the solute behaviour is much
	smoother and more regular after the fractures are filled with glass
	powder, which plays the role of a homogeneous fault gouge material.
	This is due to a perfect correlation between pore volume and transmissivity
	that causes pore velocity to be not directly dependent on the transmissivity,
	but only indirectly through the hydraulic gradient, which is a much
	smoother function due to the diffusive behaviour of the flow equation
	acting as a filter. This smoothing property of the pore volumeï?`½transmissivity
	correlation is also supported by numerical simulations of tracer
	tests in a dipole flow field. Three different conceptual models are
	used: an empty fracture, a rough-walled fracture filled with a homogeneous
	material and a parallel-plate fracture with a heterogeneous fault
	gouge. All three models are hydraulically equivalent, yet they have
	a different pore volume distribution. Even if piezometric heads and
	specific flow rates are exactly the same at any point of the domain,
	the transport process differs dramatically. These differences make
	it important to discriminate in situ among different conceptual models
	in order to simulate correctly the transport phenomena. For this
	reason, we study the solute breakthrough and recovery curves at the
	extraction wells. Our numerical case studies show that discrimination
	on the basis of such data might be impossible except under very favourable
	conditions, i.e. the integral scale of the transmissivity field has
	to be known and small compared to the dipole size. If the latter
	conditions are satisfied, discrimination between the rough-walled
	fracture filled with a homogeneous material and the other two models
	becomes possible, whereas the parallel-plate fracture with a heterogeneous
	fault gouge and the empty fracture still show identifiability problems.
	The latter may be solved by inspection of aperture and pressure testing.},

	rates are described by a convolution product of concentrations in

	the consideration of mass transfer generally yields larger estimations

	fracture approximation works well because the tracer has not penetrated
	the matrix deeply enough to be influenced by the adjacent fractures.
	In high matrix porosity, diffusion into the matrix is dominant and
	the model may be simplified by neglecting the influence of dispersivity.
	In low matrix porosity, a dispersion model with no diffusion into
	the matrix may often yield approximately the mean transit time of
	water. By contrast, in long-term tracer experiments, the tracer appears
	to exploit the whole water volume, i.e. both the mobile fissure volume

	transit time of tracer, which is related to the mean transit time
	of water by the retardation factor. This factor is expressed approximately
	by the ratio of total porosity to fissure porosity, provided the
	tracer is non-adsorbable. For adsorbable tracers the microporosity
	acts as a strong sink due to the large adsorption surface. This fact
	is most probably the cause of the discrepancies observed between
	14C ages in carbonate aquifers and the stable isotope shift expected
	from the climate change at the end of the last glaciation. It is
	also shown that the 14C exchange in carbonate rocks may yield 14C
	ages orders of magnitude too high in comparison with conventional
	flow data. Examples of the interpretation of artificial tracer experiments
	demonstrate that the model developed works surprisingly well.},

  abstract = {The field of reactive transport modeling has expanded significantly
	in the past two decades and has assisted in resolving many issues
	in Earth Sciences. Numerical models allow for detailed examination
	of coupled transport and reactions, or more general investigation
	of controlling processes over geologic time scales. Reactive transport
	models serve to provide guidance in field data collection and, in
	particular, enable researchers to link modeling and hydrogeochemical
	studies. In this state-of-science review, the key objectives were
	to examine the applicability of reactive transport codes for exploring
	issues of redox stability to depths of several hundreds of meters
	in sparsely fractured crystalline rock, with a focus on the Canadian
	Shield setting. A conceptual model of oxygen ingress and redox buffering,
	within a Shield environment at time and space scales relevant to
	nuclear waste repository performance, is developed through a review
	of previous research. This conceptual model describes geochemical
	and biological processes and mechanisms materially important to understanding
	redox buffering capacity and radionuclide mobility in the far-field.
	Consistent with this model, reactive transport codes should ideally
	be capable of simulating the effects of changing recharge water compositions
	as a result of long-term climate change, and fracture-matrix interactions
	that may govern water-rock interaction. Other aspects influencing
	the suitability of reactive transport codes include the treatment
	of various reaction and transport time scales, the ability to apply
	equilibrium or kinetic formulations simultaneously, the need to capture
	feedback between water-rock interactions and porosity-permeability
	changes, and the representation of fractured crystalline rock environments
	as discrete fracture or dual continuum media. A review of modern
	multicomponent reactive transport codes indicates a relatively high-level
	of maturity. Within the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste disposal program,
	reactive transport codes of varying complexity have been applied
	to investigate the migration of radionuclides and the geochemical
	evolution of host rock around the planned disposal facility. Through
	appropriate near- and far-field application of dual continuum codes,
	this example demonstrates how reactive transport models have been
	applied to assist in constraining historic water infiltration rates,
	interpreting the sealing of flow paths due to mineral precipitation,
	and investigating post-closure geochemical monitoring strategies.
	Natural analogue modeling studies, although few in number, are also
	of key importance as they allow the comparison of model results with
	hydrogeochemical and paleohydrogeological data over geologic time
	scales.},

	transports in fast-flowing fractures. Their greater refinement, however,
	largely offsets this numerical dispersion, promoting a highly accurate

	are compared in the realistic DFM models using second-order accurate
	runs as reference cases. With a CFL histogram, we establish target
	error criteria for CFL overstepping. This analysis indicates that
	for extreme fracture heterogeneity, only a few transport steps can
	be sufficient to analyse macro-dispersion. This makes our implicit

	scales it is generally only feasible to model the largest variations
	explicitly. Smaller-scale velocity variability must be accounted
	for indirectly, usually by increasing the magnitude of the dispersivity
	tensor (i.e. by introducing a so-called macrodispersivity). Most
	macrodispersion theories tacitly assume that a macrodispersivity
	tensor which works well when there is only small-scale velocity variability
	will also work well when there is larger-scale variability. We analyze
	this assumption in a high resolution numerical experiment which simulates
	solute transport through a two-scale velocity field. Our results
	confirm that a transport model which uses an appropriately adjusted
	macrodispersivity can reproduce the large-scale features of a solute
	plume when the velocity varies only over small scales. However, if
	the velocity field includes both small and large-scale components,
	the macrodispersivity term does not appear to be able to capture
	all of the effects of small-scale variability. In this case the predicted
	plume is more well mixed and consistently underestimates peak solute
	concentrations at all times. We believe that this result can be best
	explained by scale interactions resulting from the nonlinear transformation
	from velocity to concentration. However, additional analysis will
	be required to test this hypothesis.}},

  abstract = {{The assessment of biodegradation in contaminated aquifers has become
	an issue of increasing importance in the recent years. To some extent,
	this can be related to the acceptance of intrinsic bioremediation
	or monitored natural attenuation as a means to manage contaminated
	sites. Among the few existing methods to detect biodegradation in
	the subsurface, stable isotope fractionation analysis (SIFA) is one
	of the most promising approaches which is pronounced by the drastically
	increasing number of applications. This review covers the recent
	laboratory and field studies assessing biodegradation of contaminants
	via stable isotope analysis. Stable isotope enrichment factors have
	been found that vary from no fractionation for dioxygenase reactions
	converting aromatic hydrocarbons over moderate fractionation by monooxygenase
	reactions (epsilon=-3parts per thousand) and some anaerobic studies
	on microbial degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons (epsilon=-1.7parts
	per thousand) to larger fractionations by anaerobic dehalogenation
	reactions of chlorinated solvents (epsilon=between -5parts per thousand
	and -30parts per thousand). The different isotope enrichment factors
	can be related to the respective biochemical reactions. Based on
	that knowledge, we discuss under what circumstances SIFA can be used
	for a qualitative or even a quantitative assessment of biodegradation
	in the environment. In a steadily increasing number of cases, it
	was possible to explain biodegradation processes in the field based
	on isotope enrichment factors obtained from laboratory experiments
	with pure cultures and measured isotope values from the field. The
	review will focus on the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of aromatic
	hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents as the major contaminants of
	groundwater. Advances in the instrumental development for stable
	isotope analysis are only mentioned if it is important for the understanding
	of the application. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract = {{{[}1] Modern measurement techniques have shown that property distributions
	in natural porous and fractured media appear highly irregular and
	nonstationary in a spatial statistical sense. This implies that direct
	statistical analyses of the property distributions are not appropriate,
	because the statistical measures developed will be dependent on position
	and therefore will be nonunique. An alternative, which has been explored
	to an increasing degree during the past 20 years, is to consider
	the class of functions known as nonstationary stochastic processes
	with spatially stationary increments. When such increment distributions
	are described by probability density functions (PDFs) of the Gaussian,
	Levy, or gamma class or PDFs that converge to one of these classes
	under additions, then one is also dealing with a so-called stochastic
	fractal, the mathematical theory of which was developed during the
	first half of the last century. The scaling property associated with
	such fractals is called self-affinity, which is more general that
	geometric self-similarity. Herein we review the application of Gaussian
	and Levy stochastic fractals and multifractals in subsurface hydrology,
	mainly to porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and fracture roughness,
	along with the characteristics of flow and transport in such fields.
	Included are the development and application of fractal and multifractal
	concepts; a review of the measurement techniques, such as the borehole
	flowmeter and gas minipermeameter, that are motivating the use of
	fractal-based theories; the idea of a spatial weighting function
	associated with a measuring instrument; how fractal fields are generated;
	and descriptions of the topography and aperture distributions of
	self-affine fractures. In a somewhat different vein the last part
	of the review deals with fractal- and fragmentation-based descriptions
	of fracture networks and the implications for transport in such networks.
	Broad conclusions include the implication that models based on increment
	distributions, while more realistic, are inherently less predictive
	than models based directly on stationary stochastic processes; that
	there is presently an unresolved ambiguity when a measurement is
	attempted in a medium that exhibits property variations on all scales;
	the strong possibility that log( property) increment distributions
	that appear to be described by the Levy PDF are actually superpositions
	of several PDFs of finite variance, one for each facies; that there
	are apparent similarities in the transport behavior of heterogeneous
	porous media and fractured rock at the field scale that appear to
	be related to the existence of a few preferential flow paths in both
	types of media; and finally, that additional carefully collected
	data sets are needed to clarify and advance the fractal- based theories,
	particularly in the case of three-dimensional fracture networks where
	few data are available. Further refinement is needed also in the
	understanding of instrument spatial weighting functions in heterogeneous
	media and how measurements in media exhibiting variations on all
	scales should be interpreted.}},

  abstract = {The incorporation of microbial processes into reactive transport models
	has generally proceeded along two separate lines of investigation:
	(1) transport of bacteria as inert colloids in porous media, and
	(2) the biodegradation of dissolved contaminants by a stationary
	phase of bacteria. Research over the last decade has indicated that
	these processes are closely linked. This linkage may occur when a
	change in metabolic activity alters the attachment/detachment rates
	of bacteria to surfaces, either promoting or retarding bacterial
	transport in a groundwater-contaminant plume. Changes in metabolic
	activity, in turn, are controlled by the time of exposure of the
	microbes to electron acceptors/donor and other components affecting
	activity. Similarly, metabolic activity can affect the reversibility
	of attachment, depending on the residence time of active microbes.
	Thus, improvements in quantitative analysis of active subsurface
	biota necessitate direct linkages between substrate availability,
	metabolic activity, growth, and attachment/detachment rates. This
	linkage requires both a detailed understanding of the biological
	processes and robust quantitative representations of these processes

  abstract = {This paper discusses migration of radionuclides in the bedrock surrounding
	a repository. Currently available models use either a surface reaction
	or a bulk reaction concept to describe the retardation of migrating
	nuclides. The first model assumes that the nuclide reacts only with
	the surface of the fissures. This implies that the rock matrix is
	not utilized as a sink. The other model implies that the whole bulk
	of the rock is accessible to the nuclides. The paper analyzes the
	accessibility of the rock matrix to the radio-nuclides. The transport
	mechanisms are shown to be flow of water and nuclides in the fissures
	and transport of nuclides from the water in the fissures into water
	in the microfissures of the rock by pore diffusion. The diffusion
	of the nuclides into the rock matrix and their sorption onto the
	surfaces of the microfissures are the main mechanisms retarding migration
	from a repository. The diffusivity of the nuclide may be as important
	as its sorption equilibrium constant. Diffusivities in the pores
	and microfissures in such dense rocks as granite under confining
	pressure of hundreds of bars can be expected to be 6–20% of the diffusivity
	in water. These data are obtained from electrical resistivity measurements
	of saltwater-filled granites. Porosity of such granites varies from
	0.4 to 0.9%. The apparent diffusivities in the granites will then
	vary between 0.25 · 10−12/Kdρp and 10 · 10−12/Kdρp m2/s, where Kdρp
	is the volume equilibrium constant. This varies from the porosity
	of the rock for nonsorbing species to up to and over 104. For a 100-year
	contact time a nonsorbing nuclide can be expected to penetrate tens
	of meters of the rock matrix and a strongly sorbing nuclide with
	Kdρp larger than 104 will penetrate a few millimeters. The diffusion
	into the rock matrix can enhance the retardation by many orders of
	magnitude as compared to retardation by surface reaction in fissures
	only. The retardation may, on the other hand, be many orders of magnitude
	smaller than the maximum value that could be obtained if all the
	rock matrix were accessible. This depends very much on the fissure
	widths and spacings.},

  abstract = {{We consider advective transport in a steady state random velocity
	field with homogeneous increments. Such a field is self-affine with
	a power law dyadic semivariogram gamma(s) proportional to d(2 omega),
	where d is distance and omega is a Hurst coefficient. It is characterized
	by a fractal dimension D = E + 1 - omega, where E is topological
	dimension. As the mean and variance of such a field are undefined,
	we condition them on measurement at some point x(0). We then introduce
	a tracer at another point y(0) and invoice elementary theoretical
	considerations to demonstrate that its conditional mean dispersion
	is local at all times. Its conditional mean concentration and variance
	are given explicitly by well-established expressions which, however,
	have not been previously recognized as being valid in fractal fields.
	Once the conditional mean travel distance s of the tracer becomes
	large compared to the distance between y(0) and x(0), the corresponding
	dispersion and dispersivity tensors grow in proportion to s(1+2 omega),
	where 0 < omega < 1. This supralinear rate of growth is consistent
	with that exhibited by apparent longitudinal dispersivities obtained
	by standard methods df interpretation from tracer behavior observed
	in a variety of geologic media under varied flow and transport regimes.
	Filtering out modes from the fractal velocity held with correlation
	scales larger than some s(0) allows an asymptotic transport regime
	to develop when s >> s(0). The corresponding asymptotic dispersivities
	grow in proportion to s(0)(2 omega), when 0 < omega less than or
	equal to 1/2. This linear to sublinear rate of growth is consistent
	with that exhibited by apparent longitudinal dispersivities obtained
	from calibrated numerical models in a variety of media. A self-affine
	natural log permeability field gives rise to a self-affine velocity
	field, while s is sufficiently small to insure that the variance
	of the log permeabilities, which grows as a power of s, remains nominally
	less than one. An analysis of published apparent longitudinal dispersivity
	data in light of the above theoretical results supports my earlier
	conclusion that when one juxtaposes data from a large number of generally
	dissimilar geologic media from a variety of locales, one observes
	a tendency toward self-affine behavior with a Hurst coefficient omega

	increments, each field having its own exponential autocovariance,

	not the underlying assumption is valid, one can justify interpreting
	the apparent dispersivities in a manner consistent with a recent
	quasi-linear theory of non-Fickian and Fickian dispersion in homogeneous
	media which supports the notion of a self-similar hierarchy a posteriori.
	The hierarchy is revealed to possess a semivariogram γ(s;) ≊ cs½,

	E is the topological dimension of interest. This can be viewed as
	a universal scaling rule about which large deviations occur due to
	local influences including the existence of discrete natural scales
	at which log hydraulic conductivity is statistically homogeneous.
	As such homogeneity is at best a local phenomenon occurring intermittently
	over narrow bands of the scale spectrum, one must question the utility
	of associating medium properties with representative elementary volumes

	narrow scale intervals. Porous and fractured media appear to follow
	the same idealized scaling rule for both flow and transport, raising

  abstract = {Among the current problems that hydrogeologists face, perhaps there
	is none as challenging as the characterization of fractured rock
	(Faybishenko and Benson 2000). This paper discusses issues associated
	with the quantification of flow and transport through fractured rocks
	on scales not exceeding those typically associated with single- and
	multi-well pressure (or flow) and tracer tests. As much of the corresponding
	literature has focused on fractured crystalline rocks and hard sedimentary
	rocks such as sandstones, limestones (karst is excluded) and chalk,
	so by default does this paper. Direct quantification of flow and
	transport in such rocks is commonly done on the basis of fracture
	geometric data coupled with pressure (or flow) and tracer tests,
	which therefore form the main focus. Geological, geophysical and
	geochemical (including isotope) data are critical for the qualitative
	conceptualization of flow and transport in fractured rocks, and are
	being gradually incorporated in quantitative flow and transport models,
	in ways that this paper unfortunately cannot describe but in passing.
	The hydrogeology of fractured aquifers and other earth science aspects
	of fractured rock hydrology merit separate treatments. All evidence
	suggests that rarely can one model flow and transport in a fractured
	rock consistently by treating it as a uniform or mildly nonuniform
	isotropic continuum. Instead, one must generally account for the
	highly erratic heterogeneity, directional dependence, dual or multicomponent
	nature and multiscale behavior of fractured rocks. One way is to
	depict the rock as a network of discrete fractures (with permeable
	or impermeable matrix blocks) and another as a nonuniform (single,
	dual or multiple) continuum. A third way is to combine these into
	a hybrid model of a nonuniform continuum containing a relatively
	small number of discrete dominant features. In either case the description
	can be deterministic or stochastic. The paper contains a brief assessment
	of these trends in light of recent experimental and theoretical findings,

  abstract = {Laboratory and field measurement of hydraulic conductivity (or permeability)
	in porous media represent averages over many pores. Such measurements
	are insensitive to small variations in the volume of the porous median
	affected by a hydraulic conductivity test. This justifies treat/rig
	the hydraulic conductivity of porous media as a continuous function
	of space which varies smoothly enough to be analyzed by standard
	methods of differential calculus. Laboratory and field measurement
	of hydraulic conductivity in fractured rocks represent volumes that
	are often intersected by only a few fractures. Therefore, these measurements
	tend to be erratic and sensitive to the volume of rock sampled by
	the test. For this erratic behavior and sensitivity to be acceptably
	small, the test would have to be conducted on a relatively large
	scale at which the sample corresponds to a Representative Elementary
	Volume or REV. However, there is generally no guarantee that an REV
	can be defined for a given rock mass. When an REV can be defined,
	it is often so large as to render the measurement of its hydraulic
	conductivity impractical. To study questions related to the existence
	and properties of REV&apos;s and/or to eliminate the need for their
	use, some investigators have relied on discrete models of fracture
	network. These models require detailed deterministic and/or statistical
	information about the geometry of fractures and the spatial distribution
	of their apertures which is difficult to obtain. In addition, there
	is growing laboratory and field evidence that the manner in which
	such models translate data about fracture geometry into hydraulic
	and transport properties of the rock is open to serious questions.
	This paper describes an alternative to both the classical continuum
	concept based on an REV and the discrete fracture network approach.
	The proposed alternative places less emphasis on fracture geometric
	data than on the results of hydraulic tests conducted on scales at
	which test/rig is practical with available technology. Such tests
	usually sample rock volumes smaller than an REV and must therefore
	be analyzed statistically. However, they are generally easier to
	conduct than measuring all the geometric parameters that are required
	for the construction of reliable discrete fracture network models.
	There is evidence that hydraulic test data collected on appropriate
	sub-REV scales correlate well with logs obtained by selected borehole
	geophysical devices and with subsurface geotomographic images yet
	their correlation with geometric parameters such as fracture density
	are tenuous at best. The paper demonstrates that such hydraulic test
	data are amenable to quantitative analysis by treating them as the
	realization of a stochastic success defined over a continuum. The
	nature of this stochastic success on scales smaller and or larger
	than the scale of measurement can be studied by means of devolution
	and/or spatial averaging techniques. In this way, data obtained on
	different scales can be analyzed joinly within a unified conceptual
	framework so as with data obtained from fractured granites near Oracle,
	Arizona. The paper concludes by describing how the continuum concept
	can be used to analyze the spread of dissolved constituents in fractured
	rocks.},

  abstract = {{The subsurface consists of porous and fractured materials exhibiting
	a hierarchical geologic structure, which gives rise to systematic
	and random spatial and directional variations in hydraulic and transport
	properties on a multiplicity of scales. Traditional geostatistical
	moment analysis allows one to infer the spatial covariance structure
	of such hierarchical, multiscale geologic materials on the basis
	of numerous measurements on a given support scale across a domain
	or ``window'' of a given length scale. The resultant sample variogram
	often appears to fit a stationary variogram model with constant variance
	(sill) and integral (spatial correlation) scale. In fact, some authors,
	who recognize that hierarchical sedimentary architecture and associated
	log hydraulic conductivity fields tend to be nonstationary, nevertheless
	associate them with stationary ``exponential-like'' transition probabilities
	and variograms, respectively, the latter being a consequence of the
	former. We propose that (1) the apparent ability of stationary spatial
	statistics to characterize the covariance structure of nonstationary
	hierarchical media is an artifact stemming from the finite size of
	the windows within which geologic and hydrologic variables are ubiquitously
	sampled, and (2) the artifact is eliminated upon characterizing the
	covariance structure of such media with the aid of truncated power
	variograms, which represent stationary random fields obtained upon
	sampling a nonstationary fractal over finite windows. To support
	our opinion, we note that truncated power variograms arise formally
	when a hierarchical medium is sampled jointly across all geologic
	categories and scales within a window; cite direct evidence that
	geostatistical parameters (variance and integral scale) inferred
	on the basis of traditional variograms vary systematically with support
	and window scales; demonstrate the ability of truncated power models
	to capture these variations in terms of a few scaling parameters;
	show that exponential and truncated power variograms are often difficult
	to distinguish from each other, which helps explain why hierarchical
	data may appear to fit the former; note that truncated power models
	are unique in their ability to represent multiscale random fields
	having either Gaussian or heavy-tailed symmetric Levy stable probability
	distributions; detail the way in which these models allow conditioning
	the spatial statistics of such fields on multiscale measurements
	via cokriging; and illustrate these capabilities on multiscale hydraulic
	data from an unconfined aquifer near Tubingen, Germany.}},

	the exchange coefficient agr parametrizing the large-scale exchange

	the so-called time correlation function corresponding to the particle
	presence in the fractures. On the other hand, the large scale averaging
	theory (LSAT) as developed by Quintard and Whitaker (Quintard and
	Whitaker, 1996) gives another definition for this exchange coefficient
	agr. It also provides a so-called 'closure problem' allowing to compute
	${\alpha}$from the solution of a well-defined steady state boundary
	value problem, to be solved over a representative volume of the high
	resolution fractured map. The goal of the present paper is to show
	analytically that both definitions coincide, yielding a unique and
	well defined value of the ${\alpha}$ coefficient. This provides an

	the effects of bioavailability. We first used these two cases to
	explore the effects of selectively activating the degradation terms
	in the aqueous and sorbed phases. The models for these two cases
	consistently predict that degradation is insensitive to retardation
	if degradation terms are not included for the sorbed phase. A specific
	mass removal rate was developed as an efficiency metric to explore
	the effects of pulsed nutrient injection on contaminant degradation
	and to estimate an optimal injection interval. The contaminant mass
	degraded per unit pumping was shown to be significantly higher for
	pulsed injection of substrates than with continuous injection. The

	to be known, 2-D and 1-D models are very similar. However, the behavior
	of intermediates, which are produced and consumed in different locations

	to quantify vertical mixing in heterogeneous media. The filling mimics
	natural sediments including a distribution of different hydro-facies,
	made of different sand mixtures, and micro-structures within the
	sand lenses. We quantify the concentration distribution of the conservative
	tracer by the analysis of digital images taken at steady state during
	the tracer-dye experiment. Heterogeneity causes plume meandering,
	leading to distorted concentration profiles. Without knowledge about
	the velocity distribution, it is not possible to determine meaningful
	vertical dispersion coefficients from the concentration profiles.
	Using the stream-line pattern resulting from an inverse model of
	previous experiments in the sandbox, we can correct for the plume
	meandering. The resulting vertical dispersion coefficient is approximately
	4 ï?`½ 10[-9] m[2]/s. We observe no distinct increase in the vertical
	dispersion coefficient with increasing travel distance, indicating
	that heterogeneity has hardly any impact on vertical transverse mixing.
	In the reactive tracer test, we continuously inject an alkaline solution
	over a certain height into the domain that is occupied otherwise
	by an acidic solution. The outline of the alkaline plume is visualized
	by adding a pH indicator into both solutions. From the height and
	length of the reactive plume, we estimate a transverse dispersion
	coefficient of 3 x 10[-9] m[2]/s. Overall, the vertical transverse
	dispersion coefficients are less than an order of magnitude larger
	than pore diffusion coefficients and hardly increase due to heterogeneity.
	Thus, we conclude for the assessment of natural attenuation that
	reactive plumes might become very large if they are controlled by
	vertical dispersive mixing.},

  abstract = {{A new methodology for solution of the inverse problem in groundwater
	hydrology is proposed and applied to a site in southeastern New Mexico
	with extensive hydrogeologic data. The methodology addresses the
	issue of nonuniqueness of the inverse solutions by generating an
	ensemble of transmissivity fields considered to be equally likely,
	each of which is in agreement with the measured transmissivity and
	pressure data. It consists of generating a selected number of conditionally
	simulated transmissivity fields and then calibrating each of the
	fields to match the measured steady state or transient pressures,
	in a least squares sense. The calibration phase involves an iterative
	implementation of an automated pilot point approach coupled with
	conditional simulations. Pilot points are the parameters of calibration.
	They are synthetic transmissivity data which are added to the transmissivity
	database to produce a revised conditional simulation during calibration.
	Coupled kriging and adjoint Sensitivity analysis is employed for
	the optimal location of pilot points, and gradient search methods
	are used to derive their optimal transmissivities. The pilot point
	methodology is well suited for characterizing the spatial variability
	of the transmissivity field in contrast to methods using zonation.
	Pilot points are located where their potential for minimizing the
	objective function is the highest. This minimizes the perturbations
	in the transmissivities which are optimally assigned to the pilot
	point and results in minimal changes to the covariance structure
	of the transmissivity field. The calibrated fields honor the transmissivity
	measurements at their locations, preserve the variogram, and match
	the measured pressures in a least squares sense. Since there are
	numerous options in the execution of this methodology, computational
	experiments have been conducted to identify the most efficient among
	them. The method has been applied to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant
	(WIPP) site, in southeastern New Mexico, where the U.S. Department
	of Energy is conducting probabilistic system assessment for the permanent
	disposal of transuranic nuclear waste. The resulting calibrated transmissivity
	fields are input to a Monte Carlo analysis of the total system performance.
	The present paper, paper 1 of a two-paper presentation, describes
	the methodology. Paper 2, a companion paper, presents the methodology's

	If this statistical model applies to transport in fractured media,
	then an ensemble plume in a fractured rock domain may be modeled
	using the novel Fokker-Planck evolution equation of the operator-stable
	plume. These plumes (which include the classical multi-Gaussian as
	a subset) are typically characterized by power law leading-edge concentration
	profiles and super-Fickian growth rates. To investigate the possible
	correspondence of ensemble plumes to operator-stable densities, we
	use numerical simulations of fluid flow and solute transport through
	large-scale (2.5 km by 2.5 km), randomly generated fracture networks.
	These two-dimensional networks are generated according to fracture
	statistics obtained from field studies that describe fracture length,
	transmissivity, density, and orientation. A fracture continuum approach
	using MODFLOW is developed for the solution of fluid flow within
	the fracture network and low-permeability rock matrix, while a particle-tracking
	code, random walk particle method for simulating transport in heterogeneous
	permeable media (RWHet), is used to simulate the advective motion
	of conservative solutes through the model domain. By deterministically
	mapping individual fractures onto a highly discretized finite difference
	grid (1 m x 1 m x 1 m here), the MODFLOW ``continuum'' simulations
	can faithfully preserve details of the generated network and can
	approximate fluid flow in a discrete fracture network model. An advantage
	of the MODFLOW approach is that matrix permeability can be made nonzero
	to account for any degree of matrix flow and/or transport.}},

	These densities have, as their governing equations of transport,

	Model selection depends on the identification of either multi-Gaussian
	or operator-stable transport regimes, which in turn depends on the
	power law exponent of the fracture length distribution. Low to moderately
	fractured networks with power law fracture length exponents less
	than or equal to 1.9 produce solute plumes that exhibit power law
	leading-edge concentration profiles and super-Fickian plume growth
	rates. For these network types, a multiscaling fractional advection-dispersion
	equation (MFADE) provides a model of multidimensional solute transport

	multiple directions. The MFADE model is parameterized by a scaling
	matrix to describe the super-Fickian growth process, in which the

	of particle clouds by a multi-Gaussian (a subset of the operator
	stable) for densely fractured networks with finite variance fracture
	length distributions can be ascribed to the classical ADE where Fickian
	scaling rates pertain along orthogonal plume growth directions. Fracture
	networks show long-term particle retention in low-velocity fractures
	so that coupling of the equations of motion with retention models
	such as continuous time random walk or multirate mobile/immobile
	will increase accuracy near the source. Particle arrival times at

	Generally, arrival times are faster in sparsely fractured domains

	Geostatistics is younger but has had a very large impact in hydrogeology.
	Today, geostatistics is used routinely to interpolate deterministically
	most of the parameters that are required to analyze a problem or
	make a quantitative analysis. In a small number of cases, geostatistics
	is combined with deterministic approaches to forecast uncertainty.
	At a more academic level, geostatistics is used extensively to study
	physical processes in heterogeneous aquifers. Yet, there is an important
	gap between the academic use and the routine applications of geostatistics.
	The reasons for this gap are diverse. These include aspects related
	to the hydrogeology consulting market, technical reasons such as
	the lack of widely available software, but also a number of misconceptions.
	A change in this situation requires acting at different levels. First,
	regulators must be convinced of the benefit of using geostatistics.
	Second, the economic potential of the approach must be emphasized
	to customers. Third, the relevance of the theories needs to be increased.

  year = {2011},
  pages = { - },
  number = {0},
  abstract = {Understanding the role of connectivity for the characterization of
	heterogeneous porous aquifers or reservoirs is a very active and
	new field of research. In that framework, connectivity metrics are
	becoming important tools to describe a reservoir. In this paper,
	we provide a review of the various metrics that were proposed so
	far, and we classify them in four main groups. We define first the
	static connectivity metrics which depend only on the connectivity
	structure of the parameter fields (hydraulic conductivity or geological
	facies). By contrast, dynamic connectivity metrics are related to
	physical processes such as flow or transport. The dynamic metrics
	depend on the problem configuration and on the specific physics that
	is considered. Most dynamic connectivity metrics are directly expressed
	as a function of an upscaled physical parameter describing the overall
	behavior of the media. Another important distinction is that connectivity
	metrics can either be global or localized. The global metrics are
	not related to a specific location while the localized metrics relate
	to one or several specific points in the field. Using these metrics
	to characterize a given aquifer requires the possibility to measure
	dynamic connectivity metrics in the field, to relate them with static
	connectivity metrics, and to constrain models with those information.
	Some tools are already available for these different steps and reviewed
	here, but they are not yet routinely integrated in practical applications.
	This is why new steps should be added in hydrogeological studies
	to infer the connectivity structure and to better constrain the models.
	These steps must include specific field methodologies, interpretation
	techniques, and modeling tools to provide more realistic and more
	reliable forecasts in a broad range of applications.},

	the U.S. National Research Council (NRC 2000), destruction and strong

	Our algorithm is based on Laplace-transformed recursive finite-element

	jointly spatial variations in natural log-conductivity ( Y = ln K
	) , the parameters of its underlying variogram, and the variance–covariance
	of these estimates. Log-conductivity is parameterized geostatistically
	based on measured values at discrete locations and unknown values
	at discrete “pilot points”. Whereas prior values of Y at pilot point
	are obtained by generalized kriging, posterior estimates at pilot
	points are obtained through a maximum likelihood fit of computed

	projected onto the computational grid by kriging. Optionally, the
	maximum likelihood function may include a regularization term reflecting
	prior information about Y. The relative weight assigned to this term
	is evaluated separately from other model parameters to avoid bias
	and instability. We illustrate and explore our algorithm by means
	of a synthetic example involving a pumping well. We find that whereas
	Y and h can be reproduced quite well with parameters estimated on
	the basis of zero-order mean flow equations, all model quality criteria
	identify the second-order results as being superior to zero-order
	results. Identifying the weight of the regularization term and variogram
	parameters can be done with much lesser ambiguity based on second-
	than on zero-order results. A second-order model is required to compute
	predictive error variances of hydraulic head (and flux) a posteriori.
	Conditioning the inversion jointly on conductivity and hydraulic
	head data results in lesser predictive uncertainty than conditioning
	on conductivity or head data alone.},

	the mean and (co)variance of groundwater flow. Log conductivity is
	parameterized geostatistically based on measured values at discrete
	locations and unknown values at discrete ``pilot points.{''} Optionally,
	the maximum likelihood function on which the inverse estimation of
	Y at pilot points is based may include a regularization term reflecting
	prior information about Y. The relative weight lambda = sigma(2)(hE)/sigma(2)(YE)
	assigned to this term and its components sigma(2)(hE) and sigma(2)(YE),
	as well as h are evaluated separately from other model parameters
	to avoid bias and instability. This evaluation is done on the basis
	of criteria such as NLL, KIC, BIC, HIC, AIC, and AICc. We demonstrate
	theoretically that, whereas all these six criteria make it possible
	to estimate sigma(2)(hE), KIC alone allows one to estimate validly
	theta and sigma(2)(YE) (and thus lambda). We illustrate this discriminatory
	power of KIC numerically by using a differential evolution genetic
	search algorithm to minimize it in the context of a two-dimensional
	steady state groundwater flow problem. We find that whereas sigma(2)(hE);
	sigma(2)(YE), and the integral scale of Y can be estimated on the
	basis of a zero-order mean flow equation, the sill of the Y-variogram
	is estimated more accurately by a second-order approximation of flow.
	This notwithstanding, KIC prefers the simpler zero-order moment over
	the more complex second-order version.}},

  abstract = {This study extends and applies the theory of micromixing, first introduced
	in the chemical reaction engineering literature, to the topic of
	reactive transport in porous media. For all but the simplest linear
	kinetic and sorption models the fate and transport of a reactive
	solute depends on the residence times and the details of small-scale
	mixing. The latter phenomenon, also called micromixing, is important
	because it brings into close proximity chemical species that react,
	and it controls the local concentrations in a flowing system. Solutes
	with reaction rates or sorption isotherms that depend on species
	concentration will therefore be affected by micromixing. Two models
	for micromixing are introduced, the minimum and maximum mixedness
	models, that provide bounds on the extent of reaction or retardation
	behavior within the constraints imposed by the residence time distribution
	(RTD) of a conservative solute in the same flow system. These mixing
	models prescribe the latest or earliest permissible mixing of parcels
	of fluid of different residence times, which in turn bounds the degree
	of reaction of a reactive solute for nonlinear rate laws or sorption
	isotherms. Simulation results using the bounding models show that
	micromixing effects are most important for nonlinear reaction curves,
	solute pulses of short duration, and systems with broad RTD curves.
	Use of these models is a straightforward and practical way to investigate
	the importance of a phenomenon for which data are seldom available
	and whose impact on groundwater reactive transport models has heretofore
	not been studied in a systematic, bounding manner.},

  volume = {{46}},
  month = {{Oct 6}},
  abstract = {{This paper addresses the inverse problem in spatially variable fields
	such as hydraulic conductivity in groundwater aquifers or rainfall
	intensity in hydrology. Common to all these problems is the existence
	of a complex pattern of spatial variability of the target variables
	and observations, the multiple sources of data available for characterizing
	the fields, the complex relations between the observed and target
	variables and the multiple scales and frequencies of the observations.
	The method of anchored distributions (MAD) that we propose here is
	a general Bayesian method of inverse modeling of spatial random fields
	that addresses this complexity. The central elements of MAD are a
	modular classification of all relevant data and a new concept called
	``anchors.{''} Data types are classified by the way they relate to
	the target variable, as either local or nonlocal and as either direct
	or indirect. Anchors are devices for localization of data: they are
	used to convert nonlocal, indirect data into local distributions
	of the target variables. The target of the inversion is the derivation
	of the joint distribution of the anchors and structural parameters,
	conditional to all measurements, regardless of scale or frequency
	of measurement. The structural parameters describe large-scale trends
	of the target variable fields, whereas the anchors capture local
	inhomogeneities. Following inversion, the joint distribution of anchors
	and structural parameters is used for generating random fields of
	the target variable(s) that are conditioned on the nonlocal, indirect
	data through their anchor representation. We demonstrate MAD through
	a detailed case study that assimilates point measurements of the
	conductivity with head measurements from natural gradient flow. The
	resulting statistical distributions of the parameters are non-Gaussian.
	Similarly, the moments of the estimates of the hydraulic head are
	non-Gaussian. We provide an extended discussion of MAD vis a vis
	other inversion methods, including maximum likelihood and maximum
	a posteriori with an emphasis on the differences between MAD and
	the pilot points method.}},

	is the challenge of both accurately representing large and complex
	fracture networks and simulating matrix/fracture exchanges with a
	minimum number of gridblocks. This paper presents an efficient, patented
	solution to tackle this problem, First. a method derived from the
	well-known dual-porosity concept is presented. The approach consists
	of developing an optimized, explicit representation of the fractured
	medium and specific treatments of matrix/fracture exchanges and matrix/matrix
	flows. In this approach, matrix blocks of different volumes and shapes
	are associated with each fracture cell depending on the local geometry

	approach is that it can simulate local matrix/fracture exchanges
	on large fractured media in a much faster and more appropriate way.
	Indeed, the simulation can be carried out with a much smaller number
	of cells compared to a fully explicit discretization of both matrix
	and fracture media. The proposed approach presents other advantages

	cases in which flows are not controlled by fractures alone either
	the fracture network may be not hydraulically connected from one
	well to another, or the matrix may have a high permeability in some
	places. Finally. well-test cases demonstrate the reliability of the

	One major objective is to test how well analytic stability theory
	developed by List [1965] applies to the transport of dense plumes
	in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. The data to test the
	prediction come from numerical model experiments in which instability
	growth is generated by perturbing the interface between fluids of
	differing density. Stability criteria, as determined by the transverse
	Rayleigh number, the ratio of transverse to longitudinal Rayleigh
	numbers, and the nondimensional wave number, compare very well with
	results observed in the numerical experiments for isotropic media.
	Comparisons involving correlated random fields were much less successful
	because plume stability is determined on a local basis as a function
	of the changing permeability field. Instabilities tend to dissipate
	in zones of lower permeability and grow in zones of higher permeability.
	Another objective of the study is to determine the factors that contribute
	to stability and instability in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems.
	Sensitivity analyses using a transport model within the framework
	of Listï?`½s stability theory show that stability is promoted by
	low medium permeability, small density differences, and significant
	dispersion. In heterogeneous media, stability is promoted by increased
	correlation length scales and increased log permeability variance.
	Furthermore, the simulations illustrate the intimate relationship
	that exists between instability growth and decay and the heterogeneous
	nature of the permeability field. Thus stability criteria that do
	not incorporate characteristics of the permeability field will not
	be suitable for natural or field scale porous media.},

	Beside spatial correlation, especially the connectivity of heterogeneous
	conductivities is acknowledged to be a key factor. This has been
	demonstrated for well defined random fields having different topological
	properties. Yet, it remains an open question which morphological
	measures carry sufficient information to actually predict flow and
	transport in porous media. We analyze flow and transport in classical,
	two-dimensional random fields showing different topology and we determine
	a selection of structural characteristics including classical two-point
	statistics, chord-length distribution and Minkowski functions (four-point
	statistics) including the Euler number as a topological measure.
	Using the approach of simulated annealing for global optimization
	we generate analog random fields that are forced to reproduce one
	or several of theses structural characteristics. Finally we evaluate
	in how far the generated analogons reproduce the original flow and
	transport behavior as well as some more elaborate structural characteristics
	including percolation probabilities and the pair connectivity function.
	The results confirm that two-point statistics is insufficient to
	capture functional properties since it is not sensitive to connectivity.
	In contrast, the combination of Minkowski functions and chord length
	distributions carries sufficient information to reproduce the breakthrough
	curve of a conservative solute. Hence, global topology provided by
	the Euler number together with local clustering provided by the chord
	length distribution seems to be a powerful condensation of structural
	complexity with respect to functional properties. (C) 2010 Elsevier

	possible velocities it may experience in a flow field and the length

	Space fractional ADEs arise when velocity variations are heavy tailed
	and describe particle motion that accounts for variation in the flow

	of power law particle residence time distributions and describe particle

	column studies, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 57 1993 3895ï?`½3906 .
	Five microbial groups were considered in the model: facultatively
	aerobic bacteria or denitrifiers, fermenters, and sulfate-, manganese-,
	and iron-reducers. By simulating their growth, subsequent consumption
	of organic carbon and electron acceptors, and production of metabolic
	products, it was possible to reproduce the observed transient concentration
	changes of the reactive species. Inhibition and availability of electron
	acceptors andror organic carbon governed the transient growth behaviour
	of the different microbial groups. With the model the much slower
	growth of sulfate reducers compared to that of facultatively aerobic
	or denitrifying bacteria could be reproduced. To be able to reproduce
	the observed spatial sequence of different microbial groups a maximum
	microbial capacity had to be introduced. It restricts total microbial
	density in the porous material. Without this restriction the excessive
	organic substrate supply would have caused the microbial activity
	to be exclusively located at the immediate vicinity of the column
	inlet. The distribution of facultatively aerobic or denitrifying
	organisms and sulfate reducers in the column was determined by the
	exchange coefficient for the electron acceptor between pore water
	and biophase. The exchange of sulfate seemed to be much slower than
	that of $O\_{2}$ and $NO\_{3}^{-}$. The growth of manganese and iron
	reducers was limited by the availability of the solid electron acceptors
	Fe III and Mn IV . The testing of two hypotheses concerning the interaction
	of iron and sulfide in the column suggests that the formation of
	elemental sulfur during abiotic reductive iron dissolution is an
	important sink for sulfide. The TBC model has proven to be complex
	enough to grasp the important reactive processes. The model provides
	a temporally and spatially resolved quantification of microbial degradation
	activity. It has shown to be a useful tool in testing alternative
	hypotheses on processes which could not directly be identified from
	the observed concentration data.},

	with the impact of natural heterogeneity in solid phase reactivity

	of a structural variable to keep track of solute flux exposure to

	tracer model that is useful for determining the signature of multi-scale
	reactive solid heterogeneity in terms of solute flux distributions
	at the field scale, given realizations of three-dimensional reactive
	site density fields. First, a governing Eulerian equation for the
	non-reactive tracer model is determined by an upscaling technique
	in which it is found that the exposure time of solution to reactive
	surface areas evolves via both a macroscopic velocity and a macroscopic
	dispersion in the artificial dimension of exposure time. Second,
	we focus on the Lagrangian approach in the context of a streamtube
	ensemble and demonstrate the use of the distribution of solute flux
	over the exposure time dimension in modeling two-dimensional transport
	of a solute undergoing simplified linear reversible reactions, in
	hypothetical conditions following prior laboratory experiments. The
	distribution of solute flux over exposure time in a given case is
	a signature of the impact of heterogeneous aquifer reactivity coupled
	with a particular physical heterogeneity, boundary conditions, and
	hydraulic gradient. Rigorous application of this approach in a simulation

	Reactivity heterogeneity is expressed in terms of distributions of

	single aqueous species the combined effects of physical and reactivity
	heterogeneity on reactive solute transport can often be established

	the breakthrough curve of a passive tracer to determine the distribution

	tracers provide additional moments of the distribution of flux over
	cumulative reactivity given travel time. Thus breakthroughs of one

	by the physiological capacity of the organisms, but also by inefficient
	supply of nutrients to the microbes. Although mass transfer limitation
	of biodegradation in the subsurface has been postulated for years,
	experimental evidence is still scarce. In the column experiments
	described here, diffusive transport of 4-nitroanisole from the bulk
	solution to cells of Rhodococcus opacus strain AS2 immobilized on
	glass beads or sand appeared to be responsible for the slow transformation
	rates observed. Assuming steady state, we applied a coupled transformation/transport
	equation to these data (Best equation) and apparent bead-related
	mass transfer coefficients were found to increase in proportion to
	the surface area covered with bacteria. This implies that mass transfer
	coefficients for individual cells remained constant. In an idealized
	oligotrophic environment where cells are only loosely clustered and
	do not shield each other, we would therefore expect biodegradation
	rates to be independent from the longitudinal distribution of the
	total biomass along a given flow path. Moreover, apparent mass transfer
	coefficients increased with the grain size of the column fillings,
	but did not change upon varying the flow rate. With a limiting external
	transport step, overall transformation fluxes do not become saturated
	at concentrations as low as predicted for Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics.
	Mass transfer limitation thus offers a justification for the common
	assumption that biodegradation rates in the subsurface follow first
	order kinetics in a wide concentration range.},

	developed to quantify the fate of dissolved contaminants and their
	interaction with solid phases in domains where discrete conduit networks
	are embedded in a permeable matrix. Such hybrid systems can be found,
	for example, in flooded underground mines, discrete karstic and fractured
	systems as well as in aquifers with intersecting boreholes. RUMT3D
	specifically takes into account the two distinctly different transport
	regimes within such hybrid systems: (i) rapid transport within the
	network of the highly conductive conduits, shafts, drifts, ventilation
	raises or roadways and (ii) the low velocity regime within the considerably
	less permeable matrix. RUMT3D is an extension of the existing reactive
	transport model PHT3D. Compared to the original model, which combines
	the multi-species transport simulator MT3DMS with the geochemical
	model PHREEQC-2, RUMT3D additionally incorporates a conduit transport
	model. A benchmark problem simulating the principal processes occurring
	at contaminated sites affected by acid mine drainage (AMD) was used
	to evaluate the model. The results suggest that for the simulation
	of contaminant transport in a hybrid system the consideration of
	rapid transport pathways is necessary. Conduits can strongly affect
	groundwater hydraulics and therefore become responsible for rapid
	hydrochemical changes.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we develop a network model to determine porosity
	and permeability changes in a porous medium as a result of changes
	in the amount of biomass. The biomass is in the form of biofilms.
	Biofilms form when certain types of bacteria reproduce, bond to surfaces,
	and produce extracellular polymer (EPS) filaments that link together
	the bacteria. The pore spaces are modeled as a system of interconnected
	pipes in two and three dimensions. The radii of the pipes are given
	by a lognormal probability distribution. Volumetric flow rates through
	each of the pipes, and through the medium, are determined by solving
	a linear system of equations, with a symmetric and positive definite
	matrix. Transport through the medium is modeled by upwind, explicit
	finite difference approximations in the individual pipes. Methods
	for handling the boundary conditions between pipes and for visualizing
	the results of numerical simulations are developed. Increases in
	biomass, as a result of transport and reaction, decrease the pipe
	radii, which decreases the permeability of the medium. Relationships
	between biomass accumulation and permeability and porosity reduction
	are presented.},

	adsorbed species influence the effective radii of the pipes in the

	assumed. This property can be proved for deterministic initial conditions
	if, in addition to the statistical homogeneity of the space-random
	velocity field, the existence of unique classical solutions of the

	translation invariance of the mean Green's function cannot be assumed,

	still be estimated within an alternative approach using the It equation.
	Numerical simulations confirm the predicted asymptotic behavior of

	conditions at early times, a signature of inhomogeneous transition
	probabilities. Such memory effects are even more relevant for random
	initial conditions, which are a result of the past evolution of the

	indefinitely in case of power law correlations. It was found that

	series of experiments designed to monitor changes in the carbon isotopic
	fractionation of CH4 by Type I and Type II methanotrophic bacteria,
	we found that the magnitude of fractionation was largely due to the
	first oxidation step catalyzed by methane monooxygenase (MMO). The
	most important factor that modulates the (alpha(CH4-CH3OH)) is the
	fraction of the total CH4 oxidized per unit time, which strongly
	correlates to the cell density of the growth cultures under constant
	flow conditions. At cell densities of less than 0.1 g/L, fractionation
	factors greater than 1.03 were observed, whereas at cell densities
	greater than 0.5 g/L the fractionation factors decreased to as low
	as 1.002. At low cell densities, low concentrations of MMO limit
	the amount of CH4 oxidized, while at higher cell densities, the overall
	rates of CH4 oxidation increase sufficiently that diffusion of CH4
	from the gaseous to dissolved state and into the cells is likely
	the rate-determining step. Thus, the residual CH4 is more fractionated
	at low cell densities, when only a small fraction of the total CH4
	has been oxidized, than at high cell densities, when up to 40\% of
	the influent CH4 has been utilized. Therefore, since Rayleigh distillation
	behavior is not observed, delta C-13 values of the residual CH4 cannot
	be used to infer the amount oxidized in either laboratory or field-studies.
	The measured (alpha(CH4-CH3OH)) was the same for both Type I and
	Type II methanotrophs expressing particulate or soluble MMO. However,
	large differences in the delta C-13 values of biomass produced by
	the two types of methanotrophs were observed. Methylosinus trichosporium
	OB3b (Type II) produced biomass with delta C-13 values about 15 parts
	per thousand higher than the dissimilated CO2, whereas Methylomonas
	methanica (Type I) produced biomass with delta C-13 values only about
	6 parts per thousand higher than the CO2. These effects were independent

	Expressions for microbial growth are incorporated into a geochemical
	reaction network linking redox reaction rates to the activity of
	the microorganisms. A flexible simulation environment, the Biogeochemical
	Reaction Network Simulator (BRNS) is used for this purpose. Two reactive
	transport applications relevant to fields of contaminant hydrology
	and early diagenesis are simulated with the BRNS. Model results are
	evaluated based on a comparison with comprehensive datasets on the
	biodegradation of lactate in a sand column experiment and on the
	distribution of redox-sensitive chemical species in marine sediments
	of the Skagerrak, Denmark. It is shown that, despite quite different
	transport regimes, the geomicrobiological model performs equally
	well in the reproduction of measured chemical species distribution
	for both applications. This result emphasizes the broad applicability
	of the proposed approach. Our simulations support that the competitive
	behavior between various microbial groups is a process controlling
	the development of redox stratified environments. Furthermore, it
	is also shown that the transport regime is a key controlling factor
	for the degree of spatial correlation between microbial biomass distributions
	and redox reaction rates. Although all our simulations yield a pronounced
	stratification of the redox processes in the system, the biomass
	distribution is related to the associated reaction rates only in
	case of the advection controlled column experiment. In the early
	diagenetic application, mixing due to bioturbation is the dominant
	transport process for particulate matter, hence leading to fairly
	homogeneous distribution of bacterial biomasses which are unrelated
	to the spatial distribution of redox reaction rates. This homogeneous
	biomass distribution combined with the 1G carbon degradation model
	approach might explain why the steady state concentration profiles
	in such systems can be reproduced by diagenetic models without explicit
	representation of microbial growth.},

	In many natural and engineered systems the bioavailable concentration

	is coupled to a preceding transport step controlling the bioavailability

	in a two-dimensional flow field in a saturated porous medium. A flow
	cell (56 x 44 x 1 cm) was filled with glass beads and operated under
	a continuous flow of a mineral medium containing nitrate as electron
	acceptor. A glucose solution was injected through an injection port,
	simulating a point source contamination. Visible light transmission
	was used to observe the distribution of the growing biomass and water
	flow during the experiment. At the end of the experiment (on day
	31), porous medium samples were destructively collected and analyzed
	for abundance of total and active bacterial cells, bacterial cell
	volume and concentration of polysaccharides and proteins. Microbial
	growth was observed in two stripes along the length of the flow cell,
	starting at the glucose injection port, where highest biomass concentrations
	were obtained. The spatial distribution of biomass indicated that
	microbial activity was limited by transverse mixing between glucose
	and nitrate media, as only in the mixing zone between the media high
	biological activities were achieved. The ability of the biomass to
	change the flow pattern in the flow cell was observed, indicating
	that the biomass was locally reducing the hydraulic conductivity
	of the porous medium. This bioclogging effect became evident when
	the injection of the glucose solution was turned off and water flow
	still bypassed the area around the glucose injection port, preserving
	the flow pattern as it was during the injection of the glucose solution.
	As flow bypass was possible in this system, the average hydraulic
	properties of the flow cell were not affected by the produced biomass.
	Even in the vicinity of the injection port, the total volume of the
	bacterial cells remained below 0.01\% of the pore space and was unlikely
	to be responsible for the bioclogging. However, the bacteria produced
	large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which

  abstract = {{A stochastic continuum model of a fractured medium conditioned on
	a specific set of field data is developed. Both the more conductive
	fractures and the less permeable matrix are generated within the
	framework of a single-continuum stochastic model based on nonparametric
	indicator geostatistics. In the stochastic model the fracture zones
	are distinguished from the matrix by imposing a long-range correlation
	structure for a small fraction (the highest approximately 11\%) of
	the hydraulic conductivity in the preferred planes of fracture zones.
	Results of flow and transport simulation in three dimensions (3D)
	are used to illustrate the large spatial variability of point measurements,
	but for spatially integrated quantities the variability is reduced
	and results become less sensitive to correlation structure. Therefore
	it is suggested that spatially integrated quantities may be a more
	appropriate choice for predicting flow and transport in a strongly
	heterogeneous medium in that they are more commensurate with the
	level of our ignorance of the site. The issue of spatial variability
	giving rise to uncertainty in the site characterization of a heterogeneous
	medium and the prediction of transport results is also addressed.
	Simulations are carried out for 3D transport from point tracer sources
	at hundreds of locations in the medium. The breakthrough curve from
	each point source release is characterized by two parameters: the
	mean transport velocity and the dispersion coefficient. The results
	are presented as a statistical distribution of the transport parameters,
	thus quantifying the uncertainty in predicting flow and transport
	based on a limited amount of site characterization data.}},

	relatively unstructured, fine to medium sands, underlain by a 0.1-0.8
	m thick peaty layer and a 0.1 m thick organic-rich horizon. Between
	depths of 3.05 and 6.10 m the aquifer is comprised of clean, horizontally
	bedded fine to medium sands similar to those examined by Sudicky
	previously. Statistical analysis of 642 subsamples of 5 cm length
	from this interval suggests that the permeability data may follow
	a log-normal distribution, with a mean In-transformed permeability
	(m(2)) of -25.67 and a variance of 0.585. No consistent trend with
	depth was detected for ln-k, or for the mean and variance of ln-k
	on a core by core basis. Exponential, spherical, and Gaussian models
	all provided excellent fits to the vertical experimental variogram
	calculated using the classical estimator without the removal of outliers.
	These fits produced correlation scales ranging from 0.16 to 0.23
	m. Of the three theoretical models, only the Gaussian model produced
	a reasonable fit to the horizontal experimental variogram with a
	correlation scale of 4.8 m. A linear model was also found to fit
	the experimental variogram data well. In comparison with earlier
	results of Sudicky, and Woodbury and Sudicky, it can be concluded
	that similar deposits were examined in this study, particularly with
	respect to correlation structure. On the basis of statistical tests,
	however, it cannot be concluded that the mean and variance of ln-k
	are stationary over the 60 m distance between the cores examined
	in this study and those of Sudicky. The results of this study indicate
	that the Borden hydraulic conductivity held is relatively uniform
	over the scale examined, but that it cannot be characterized by a

	recently that (I) the Rayleigh equation systematically underestimates
	the extent of biodegradation in physically heterogeneous systems,

	two isotope effects not captured by the Rayleigh equation by means
	of a numerical modeling approach. The reactive multicomponent transport
	simulations show that the systematic underestimation is considerably
	larger for fringe-controlled and Monod-type degradation reactions
	than for previously assumed redox-insensitive first-order degradation
	kinetics, while for the nonsteady state front portion of plumes,
	the Rayleigh equation may falsely indicate the occurrence of and/or
	overestimate biodegradation. The latter anomaly results from carbon
	isotope fractionation during sorption. It occurs for both supply-controlled
	degradation at the plume fringe and slow, reaction-controlled degradation
	inside the plume core. The numerical model approach enables a more

	object. Most of the physical material properties including mechanical
	and hydraulic characteristics are immediately linked to the structure
	given by the pore space and its spatial distribution. It is an old
	dream and still a formidable challenge to relate structural features
	of porous media to their functional properties. Using tomographic
	techniques, soil structure can be directly observed at a range of
	spatial scales. In this paper we present a scale-invariant concept
	to quantify complex structures based on a limited set of meaningful
	morphological functions. They are based on d+1 Minkowski functionals
	as defined for d-dimensional bodies. These basic quantities are determined
	as a function of pore size or aggregate size obtained by filter procedures
	using mathematical morphology. The resulting Minkowski functions
	provide valuable information on the size of pores and aggregates,
	the pore surface area and the pore topology having the potential
	to be linked to physical properties. The theoretical background and
	the related algorithms are presented and the approach is demonstrated
	for the pore structure of an arable soil and the pore structure of
	a sand both obtained by X-ray micro-tomography. We also analyze the
	fundamental problem of limited resolution which is critical for any
	attempt to quantify structural features at any scale using samples
	of different size recorded at different resolutions. The results
	demonstrate that objects smaller than 5 voxels are critical for quantitative

	crucial property is the topology of the structure because it is difficult

	as a binary structure, and at a larger scale defined by continuous
	macroscopic state variables as phase density or permeability. At
	the pore scale a connectivity function is introduced which is defined
	by the Euler characteristic as a function of the pore diameter. This
	function is used to generate network model of the porous structure
	that allow to predict bulk hydraulic properties of the material.
	At the continuum scale the structure is represented on a grey scale

	Here, topology is quantified by a connectivity function defined by
	the Euler characteristic as a function of a porosity threshold. Results
	are presented for the structure of natural soils measured by X-ray

  abstract = {The effect of aquifer heterogeneity on flow and solute transport in
	two-dimensional isotropic porous media was analyzed using the Monte
	Carlo method. The two-dimensional logarithmic permeability (ln K)
	was assumed to be a non-stationary random field with its increments
	being a truncated fractional L{\'e}vy motion (fLm). The permeability
	fields were generated using the modified successive random additions
	(SRA) algorithm code SRA3DC [http://www.iamg.org/CGEditor/index.htm].
	The velocity and concentration fields were computed respectively
	for two-dimensional flow and transport with a pulse input using the
	finite difference codes of MODFLOW 2000 and MT3DMS. Two fLm control
	parameters, namely the width parameter (C) and the L{\'e}vy index
	([alpha]), were varied systematically to examine their effect on
	the resulting permeability, flow velocity and concentration fields.
	We also computed the first- and second-spatial moments, the dilution
	index, as well as the breakthrough curves at different control planes
	with the corresponding concentration fields. In addition, the derived
	breakthrough curves were fitted using the continuous time random
	walk (CTRW) and the traditional advection-dispersion equation (ADE).
	Results indicated that larger C and smaller [alpha] both led to more
	heterogeneous permeability and velocity fields. The L{\'e}vy-stable
	distribution of increments in ln K resulted in a L{\'e}vy-stable
	distribution of increments in logarithm of the velocity (ln v). Both
	larger C and smaller [alpha] created sharper leading edges and wider
	tailing edges of solute plumes. Furthermore, a relatively larger
	amount of solute still remained in the domain after a relatively
	longer time transport for smaller [alpha] values. The dilution indices
	were smaller than unity and increased as C increased and [alpha]
	decreased. The solute plume and its second-spatial moments increased
	as C increased and [alpha] decreased, while the first-spatial moments
	of the solute plume were independent of C and [alpha] values. The
	longitudinal macrodispersivity was scale-dependent and increased
	as a power law function of time. Increasing C and decreasing [alpha]
	both resulted in an increase in longitudinal macrodispersivity. The
	transport in such highly heterogeneous media was slightly non-Gaussian
	with its derived breakthrough curves being slightly better fitted
	by the CTRW than the ADE, especially in the early arrivals and late-time

  abstract = {Biodegradation is an important process contributing to the natural
	attenuation (NA) of organic contaminants in groundwater. A numerical
	model was created to describe anaerobic phenol biodegradation data
	from an aquifer-derived laboratory scale microcosm. The dynamic behaviour
	of the system was simulated by considering a two-step syntrophic
	biodegradation model with fermentation and respiration steps, both
	simulated kinetically, and with hydrogen and acetate as intermediate
	species, and additionally, other geochemical reactions including
	aqueous speciation, surface complexation, mineral dissolution and
	precipitation. The model suggested microbial competition between
	respiration processes using different electron acceptors was important.
	In contrast, a partial equilibrium approach, considering only thermodynamics,
	and not kinetics, for respiration, did not explain the data. The
	laboratory scale biodegradation model was transferred to a field
	scale reactive transport model of the phenol plume at Four Ashes,
	UK. The effects of acclimatisation, toxicity, and bioavailability
	on microbial kinetics were considered. The simulations suggest that
	plume core processes are much more important than previously thought,
	possibly with a greater impact than plume fringe processes. The field
	scale model was computationally demanding due to the biogeochemical
	complexity. Two strategies for dealing with high computational demands
	are (i) parallel processing, where the workload is shared between
	multiple processors, and (ii) locally adaptive remeshing, where a
	refined area of the grid tracks moving plume fringes through the
	domain. A new code was developed using the partial differential equation
	software toolbox, UG, and tested against other biodegradation simulators.
	The relative efficiency of parallel, adaptive methods for multi-species
	biodegradation simulations was measured. It appears, in general,
	that relatively complex models are required for the realistic, quantitative
	assessment of NA at field scale, and that parallel, adaptive numerical
	methods provide appropriate efficiency benefits for such simulations.},

  abstract = {Biodegrading plumes in groundwater are often typified by relatively
	reactive zones around the fringes and less reactive zones in the
	core. A high degree of refinement is required at the fringes if a
	model is to be of use in improving the conceptual understanding of
	plumes. Two strategies for dealing with the potentially high computational
	demands are (i) parallel processing, where the workload is shared
	between multiple processors, and (ii) locally adaptive remeshing,
	where a refined area of the grid tracks the moving plume fringes
	through the domain. The partial differential equation toolbox, UG
	(Unstructured Grids) offers advanced numerical tools including adaptive
	remeshing, sparse matrix storage schemes, and multigrid solvers.
	It embraces many of these features within a parallel processing environment.
	This paper reports on a recent development of UG to simulate field
	scale reactive biogeochemistry including Monod kinetics, NAPL dissolution,
	mineral precipitation/dissolution and ion exchange. The non-linear
	multicomponent reactive transport system is solved with the fully
	coupled method. Test cases have been used for verification of the
	new capability. The paper illustrates an application to a 3D field
	site. It is demonstrated that both adaptive remeshing and parallel

	of a more complex set of species and reactions such that understanding

  abstract = {Many spatial fields exhibit connectivity features that have an important
	influence on hydrologic behavior. Examples include high-conductivity
	preferred flow paths in aquifers and saturated source areas in drainage
	lines. Connected features can be considered as arbitrarily shaped
	bands or pathways of connected pixels having similar (e.g., high)
	values. Connectivity is a property that is not captured by standard
	geostatistical approaches, which assume that spatial variation occurs
	in the most random possible way that is consistent with the spatial
	correlation, nor is it captured by indicator geostatistics. An alternative
	approach is to use connectivity functions. In this paper we apply
	connectivity functions to 13 observed soil moisture patterns from
	the Tarrawarra catchment and two synthetic aquifer conductivity patterns.
	It is shown that the connectivity functions are able to distinguish
	between connected and disconnected patterns. The importance of the
	connectivity in determining hydrologic behavior is explored using
	rainfall-runoff simulations and groundwater transport simulations.
	We propose the integral connectivity scale as a measure of the presence
	of hydrologic connectivity. Links between the connectivity functions
	and integral connectivity scale and simulated hydrologic behavior
	are demonstrated and explained from a hydrologic process perspective.
	Connectivity functions and the integral connectivity scale provide
	promising means for characterizing features that exist in observed

  year = {2003},
  volume = {39},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {In this work, we use the method of volume averaging to determine the
	effective dispersion tensor for a heterogeneous porous medium; closure
	for the averaged equation is obtained by solution of a concentration
	deviation equation over a periodic unit cell. Our purpose is to show
	how the method of volume averaging with closure can be rectified
	with the results obtained by other upscaling methods under particular
	conditions. Although this rectification is something that is generally
	believed to be true, there has been very little research that explores
	this issue explicitly. We show that under certain limiting (but mild)
	assumptions, the closure problem provides a Fourier series solution
	for the effective dispersion tensor. When second-order spatial stationarity
	is imposed on the velocity field, the method yields a simple Fourier
	series that converges to an integral form in the limit as the period
	of the unit cell approaches infinity. This limiting result is identical
	to the quasi-Fickian forms that have been developed previously via
	ensemble averaging by Deng et al. [1993] and recently by Fiori and
	Dagan [2000] except in the definition of the averaging operation.
	As a second objective we have conducted a numerical study to evaluate
	the influence of the size of the averaging volume on the effective
	dispersion tensor and its volume averaged statistics. This second
	objective is complimentary in many ways to recent research reported
	by Rubin et al. [1999] (via ensemble averaging) and by Wang and Kitanidis
	[1999] (via volume averaging) on the block-averaged effective dispersion
	tensor. The variability of the effective dispersion tensor from realization
	to realization is assessed by computing the volume-averaged effective
	dispersion tensor for an ensemble of finite fields with the same
	(ensemble) statistics. Ensembles were generated using three different
	sizes of unit cells. All three unit cell sizes yield similar results
	for the value of the mean effective dispersion tensor. However, the
	coefficient of variation depends strongly upon the size of the unit
	cell, and our results are consistent with those developed by Fiori
	[1998] from the ensemble averaging perspective. This implies that
	in applications the actual value of the effective dispersion tensor
	may be significantly different than expected on the basis of unconditioned
	hydraulic conductivity statistics, and this variation should be considered
	when applying macrodispersion to real-world systems.},

	reveal that a number of outliers (low In (K) values) are present
	in the data base. These low values cause difficulties in both variogram
	estimation and determining population statistics. The analysis shows
	that assuming either a normal distribution or exponential distribution
	for log conductivity is appropriate. The classical, Cressie/Hawkins
	and squared median of the absolute deviations (SMAD) estimators are
	used to compute experimental variograms. None of these estimators
	provides completely satisfactory variograms for the Borden data with
	the exception of the classical estimator with outliers removed from
	the data set. Theoretical exponential variogram parameters are determined
	from nonlinear (NL) estimation. Differences are obtained between
	NL fits and those of Sudicky (1986). For the classical-screened estimated
	variogram, NL fits produce an In (K) variance of 0.24, nugget of
	0.07, and integral scales of 5.1 m horizontal and 0.21 m vertical
	along A-A'. For B-B' these values are 0.37, 0.11, 8.3 and 0.34. The

	different than the parameter set determined for A-A'. We also evaluate
	a probabilistic form of Dagan's (1982, 1987) equations relating geostatistical
	parameters to a tracer cloud's spreading moments. The equations are
	evaluated using the parameter estimates and covariances determined
	from line A-A' as input, with a velocity equal to 9.0 cm/day. The

	Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer the opportunity
	to measure not only the pore geometry, but also local fluid velocities
	under steady-state flow conditions in 3D and with high spatial resolution.
	In this paper, we present a 3D velocity field measured at sub-pore
	resolution (tens of micrometers) over a centimeter-scale 3D domain
	using MRI methods. We have utilized the measured pore geometry to
	perform 3D simulations of Navier-Stokes flow over the same domain
	using direct numerical simulation techniques. We present a comparison
	of the numerical simulation results with the measured velocity field.
	It is shown that the numerical results match the observed velocity
	patterns well overall except for a variance and small systematic
	scaling which can be attributed to the known experimental uncertainty
	in the MRI measurements. The comparisons presented here provide strong
	validation of the pore-scale simulation methods and new insights
	for interpretation of uncertainty in MRI measurements of pore-scale
	velocity. This study also provides a potential benchmark for future
	comparison of other pore-scale simulation methods. Â© 2012 Elsevier

  abstract = {{Hydrologic systems are open and complex, rendering them prone to
	multiple conceptualizations and mathematical descriptions. There
	has been a growing tendency to postulate several alternative hydrologic
	models for a site and use model selection criteria to (1) rank these
	models, (2) eliminate some of them, and/or (3) weigh and average
	predictions and statistics generated by multiple models. This has
	led to some debate among hydrogeologists about the merits and demerits
	of common model selection (also known as model discrimination or
	information) criteria such as AIC, AICc, BIC, and KIC and some lack
	of clarity about the proper interpretation and mathematical representation
	of each criterion. We examine the model selection literature to find
	that (1) all published rigorous derivations of AIC and AICc require
	that the (true) model having generated the observational data be
	in the set of candidate models; (2) though BIC and KIC were originally
	derived by assuming that such a model is in the set, BIC has been
	rederived by Cavanaugh and Neath (1999) without the need for such
	an assumption; and (3) KIC reduces to BIC as the number of observations
	becomes large relative to the number of adjustable model parameters,
	implying that it likewise does not require the existence of a true
	model in the set of alternatives. We explain why KIC is the only
	criterion accounting validly for the likelihood of prior parameter
	estimates, elucidate the unique role that the Fisher information
	matrix plays in KIC, and demonstrate through an example that it imbues
	KIC with desirable model selection properties not shared by AIC,
	AICc, or BIC. Our example appears to provide the first comprehensive
	test of how AIC, AICc, BIC, and KIC weigh and rank alternative models
	in light of the models' predictive performance under cross validation

	describing matrix diffusion processes at the field scale. Forty field
	tracer tests at 15 fractured geologic sites were surveyed and selected
	for the study, based on data availability and quality. Field-scale
	D-m(e) values were calculated, either directly using data reported
	in the literature, or by reanalyzing the corresponding field tracer
	tests. The reanalysis was conducted for the selected tracer tests
	using analytic or semi-analytic solutions for tracer transport in
	linear, radial, or interwell flow fields. Surveyed data show that
	the scale factor of the effective matrix diffusion coefficient (defined
	as the ratio of D-m(e) to the lab-scale matrix diffusion coefficient,
	D-m, of the same tracer) is generally larger than one, indicating
	that the effective matrix diffusion coefficient in the field is comparatively
	larger than the matrix diffusion coefficient at the rock-core scale.
	This larger value can be attributed to the many mass-transfer processes
	at different scales in naturally heterogeneous, fractured rock systems.
	Furthermore, we observed a moderate, on average trend toward systematic
	increase in the scale factor with observation scale. This trend suggests
	that the effective matrix diffusion coefficient is likely to be statistically
	scale-dependent. The scale-factor value ranges from 0.5 to 884 for
	observation scales from 5 to 2000 in. At a given scale, the scale
	factor varies by two orders of magnitude, reflecting the influence
	of differing degrees of fractured rock heterogeneity at different
	geologic sites. In addition, the surveyed data indicate that field-scale
	longitudinal dispersivity generally increases with observation scale,

	We find substantially different flow and transport behaviors in the
